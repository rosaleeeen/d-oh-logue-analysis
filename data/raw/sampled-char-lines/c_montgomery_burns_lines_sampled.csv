"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"

"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."
But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes. I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.
"Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!"

"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
"I am pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. What's the name of this gastropod?"

"Hi, ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut. That is all."
"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
"Smithers, I've designed a new plane. I call it the Spruce Moose, and it will carry two hundred passengers from New York's Idlewild Airport to the Belgian Congo in seventeen minutes."
"Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let's call it heart."

"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails."
"Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be interested in a mere bauble. Her greatest treasure would be a pure young girl. You are pure, aren't you?"
"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
I see it all now! You're just a bunch of yesmen! I was making the wrong moves and you were too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right?
How dare you destroy my valuable wall and spill my priceless acid?! Did you really think you were going to get away with it?

"Uh, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love. I bring you fear, famine, pestilence, and..."
"Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone."

"Smithers, you are the campiest of my aides du camp, but I'm afraid my true admiration is reserved for the self-made man. No Steve Woz-ni-ak thee."
"Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."
"Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari."
"-- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand."
"Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to be getting dumber by the minute. I've never seen anything quite like it... Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation."
"OH, MY TAPESTRY'S MEDIEVAL, / MY HEART, IT'S EVIL TOO / BUT THAT DON'T MEAN I DON'T NEED LOVE / FROM LESSER TYPES LIKE YOU!"

My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul! They never even had a chance! Whoever did this will never get past me!
"Ah. Excellent. This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. But, but how do we turn your average Joe Sixpack against Mary Bailey?"

"Take fifty percent of my money and put it in the blue chips: Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats, Congreve's Inflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore Opera Hat Company. That should set things right again, eh, boys?"

"I don't understand. She was my young, sexy fiancÃ©e, he was my sexually virile best friend, and they just drove off in my Bugatti Sexarossa. How could this ever have happened?"
"Welcome to Earth, local time is ten-thirty-seven, we know you have your choice of portals so thank you for choosing the Burns Hellport, a division of Gulf and Western."
"The electric chair is on, eh? Then the old prison has been getting free electricity for thirty years. I'll put a stop to that."

"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one."
"Well... all right, then. I don't want to seem like an ogre. I'll bide my time. Let him twist in the wind... slowly... slowly. And then... when the papers have found their new ""flavor of the month"", he'll find out this cat has claws!"
Installing an M.H.D. Generator would allow the plant to operate at a higher temperature without the tyranny of moving parts. Using conducting plasma as the moving conductor...
"Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal"

"This is my pride and joy. I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield. I got the idea from that movie ""Sliver."" What a delightful romp!"
