"Whew! I thought it was an inventory issue. That's a big relief. Now don't worry, I'll let 'em down easy. In four years!"
"Just a sec. Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymour Butts!"
"Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now..."
"I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys."
"You know, I think you're right there, Midge. I'm gonna build my bar back up better than ever. How hard can it be, eh?"
"And that's me. Hey, thank you, guys. Thanks. It's a brand new day."
I'm sorry guys. We're shuttin' down for a while. Sorry.
"Okay, Midge. You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy. But what can we do about it now? It's not like we can play the game over again."
"Oh, look at that show-off... kissing his own muscles. Boo!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. It ain't stealin' if you take it fast."
"No, it's true. I've got their names written down right here, in what I call my, uh, ""enemies list""."
"Wait a minute... Listen, you little yellow-belly rat jackass, if I ever find out who you are, I'll kill ya!"
"Hey, this job's fallin' apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!"
"All right, customers! And they said you couldn't open a bar in Kansas."
"Carl Carlson, you just saved my life! Hey, get out of there!"
"It's too late -- I don't got the cash to clean up the bar. From now on, you guys are gonna hafta do your drinking across the street."
"Ooh. I don't think he'll be, doin' no encores for a while."
Are you kiddin'? Homer's the one what wised us up to the sexy goin's on.
"Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'm gonna have to charge ya."
"Oh, hey, get outta the way, pal. You're blocking the exit."
"Yeah, she was a knockout. Which meant I was screwed. Because now I had to send her a picture of me."
"Oh, that's it, baby. All for Moe. Oh, yeah. Work the slot. Show me the package."
Let's have a minute of silent prayer for our good friend Homer Simpson.
"Oh, no problem. You know, it-it gave me kind of a good warm feelin'. Like when you get drunk and fall asleep in the snow."
"Uh, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old time's sake."
"Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer."
"Yeah, well uh I-I, was just saying that um...I thought it up all by myself."
We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down. Mom and Pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.
"Hey, you-you wanna see me uh, dislocate my arm? Take a look at this."
"Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Hey, Chief Wiggum! Can you help me find my bar rag?"
"Nah, nah, nah, you got it wrong, Pu. She's blue fifty-six."
"Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons ."
"Now, guess how much of the twenty million I saw?"
"Uh, excuse me, is this the seminar where you learn how to pick up free escorts?"
"Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going."
"Hey, screw this. I'm not gonna let any human tell me what to do."
"Who cares? You're goin' out with me. She's going out with me, cat!"
"All right, that's it. Get 'em outta here. This ain't no crow bar."
"Hey, sounds great. Maybe then you could afford to rent your own dumpster."
"Hey clown, we've heard your stand-up, now how about some shut-up!"
"Oh. Then I'll have to charge you extra, depending on the color. Uh, stick out your tongue."
"And are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?"
"Here you go, Mr. Plow. A beer on the house."
"Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill."
"Uh, when you say broke, do you mean really broke, or uh, ""O.J. Simpson broke?"""
"Oh, great. Uh, well why don't you play with the baby while I go rent a room?"
I was already makin' excuses not to go to your funeral.
"You are absolutely, positively the dumbest haunted love tester that I have ever met!"
It means it's not like you're gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.
"Marge, sorry to call you so late but I had a great idea: put cutesy signs outside the restrooms that say ""dukes"" and ""dames"" instead of the ones we have now that say ""standups"" and ""sitdowns."" Huh? Tell me honestly, what do you think?"
"Well, I was gonna erase those two apostrophes and replace 'em with 'g's, but that's about it. So, you know, call anytime."
"Hold on, I'll check. Ah, is, I.P. Freely here? Hey everybody, I.P. Freely?"
"Nothin', nothin'. Just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity."
"Sorry, Grampa, but I gotta stash you in the bathroom so Betty won't get wise to us."
But I thought you didn't wanna date a tavern owner.
I think it's a sign from God that we should all go nuts.
"Come to papa... Wait a minute! You have a straight flush, Homer. Go! You do this every time. You... oh, you, ah, ... I'm choking on my own rage here."
"Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you."
"Now, promise me you'll leave her be, and wipe down your back seats annually..."
"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
Oh I really felt there was a connection and I-I would definitely go out with her again.
"Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ow! A snake in the cash register. Great prank, fellas, great. Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight."
Crazy me. Thinkin' I needed a rag for a friend.
"Thank you, but I am very happy with my clientele as they are."
"Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. If you make it through the night, you're welcome back."
"...the last angry clown, the man who spews truth from every orifice, ladies and gentlemen... Krusty!"
"Aw, that's the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that ""The Stinger."" They... they don't let you use that no more."
"Look, I was insensitive and I'm sorry. But what this is really about is a bully with a winch."
"Oh, I-I'm just thinkin' about a-a great tennis match I saw once. Yeah."
"Oh of course, of course. Um, I-I just have to -- I have to tidy up the place! Just one second."
"You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad."
Throwin' stuff! Get yer throwin' stuff! Turn a protest into a riot!
"Go! Go! Geez, I'm the only one in the audience over fifteen."
"Might as well face it, I'll never find anyone. Come on tide -- take me with ya. I just don't wanna feel no more pain."
"Uh, these are some of the local alcoholics I told you about."
"By ""express"" I mean you express your anger and hatred."
"Yeah, well listen, lady. I've got so many problems, I.... I don't even know where to begin here."
What's the matter? I'm making as nice as I can.
"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
Twelve kids died at our camp. We need the money to pay lawyers.
Oh... I guess Carl ain't back yet from cashin' in the ticket.
"Uh, long story. Uh, we were trying to impress some girls -- and things kinda got away from us."
Hmm. Looks like my character gets back together with that evil Contessa.
"All rightee... Uh, number one: I've lost the will to live."
"Full house, jacks over twos. Ha ha-ha, read 'em and strip, Barn."
"Well, anyone can get a laugh at the expense of an ugly dog. But crazy beards? That's where the big boys play."
I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl. He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.
"That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?"
Is it true that if I kill you I become you?
Hey torso! What's with the cookies? Even the human snail would've been done by now!
"Hot damn, I won! Marge, I swear I'll be the best man you ever had. It's gonna be all flowers and back rubs and how-was-your-day dear and--"
"""Channel sixty-one, Family Favorites. Channel sixty-two, Adult Desires. Channel sixty-three, In-Room Checkout... ch--"""
"Hey, he bit me back! So that's how it's gonna be, huh?"
HERE COMES THE MOE / WITH A PRETTY GIRL / 'CAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED / IN RE-AL LIFE
"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
"I had plans for that money too -- I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce! Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas, bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it..."
"How much to have Bart crank-call me? That would be hilarious. Eh, that's just me, though. You know, I love to laugh."
"Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe."
"Yeah, three times. The last one was nominated for a Peabody, whatever that is."
I took out the passenger seat to save gas. But I'm gonna use it now. 'Cause we're gonna do the town!
