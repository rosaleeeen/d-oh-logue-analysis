And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
"You ever scrub your hands real fast, and think you're seein' a third one? One time I looked down and there really was. I gotta get a new lock for that bathroom."
"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
"A new suit? Oh, ho, ho! I'll be the best-dressed john in the whorehouse! But listen, are you guys sure you wanna spring for something that expensive?"
"Oh, oh, Grizzly Shawn, that's so nice of you to think of me. But... uh... the Tony Awards are that night and I'll be too keyed up to have fun."
"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
"Wait a minute. Listen, to me you lousy bum! When I get a hold of you you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half!"
I say we welcome our winter tourists with open arms -- then gouge the hell out of 'em! Who? Who will gouge with me?
"White rabbit... chicks poppin' mushrooms... this is like the Playboy Mansion. Maybe I can think of a story uh, more suitable for a baby."
"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."
"Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'."
"Homer... this bar's only for real Americans. And people on permanent visas, like me. What? What are you all lookin' at? I'm Dutch. Eh, forget all of you."
"Midge, uh, condolences on your bereavement there. If, uh y'know, after a respectful period of grief and whatnot, uh, yous would like to have some coffee... please give a call. Yeah."
"If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--"
Perhaps I should've told you in person. But there's no easy way to say goodbye forever. So I'll say it the hardest way I can: in Mandarin Chinese. Zai jian yong yuan!
This says I ain't allergic to pollen. So I could'a gone to the park and played with other kids. I gotta make up for lost time!
"Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you're outta here."
"Nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me."
"Aw, come on folks! Wait! Please, come back! Please! I got a new offer! Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak... fish."
"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
"Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons ."
"Oooh, boy. All right, let's see here, uh... Well I was born in Indiana... so that ain't it. And, uh... I better call my Lifeline."
This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy.
"And we can drink champagne out of an acorn top. Our first dance will be on the head of a pin! I've been hoggin' all the good ones. All right, now you go. But hey, keep it short!"
"Hey, hey, hey! I'm not the villain here, okay? If Homer gets killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative attitude! There, I said it."
"Groundskeeper Willie, you know the guy in the skirt? He bought himself a mail-order bride, but he was too cheap to pay the C.O.D., right? So she's still in a crate down at the post office! Wanna go look-see?"
"Yeah, that's enough there, 'Pu. Look, Ned, I know we ain't hung out much, what with your insane fear of drinking and me being banned from the church and all, but ah... but that Maude, she was really something."
"I dunno if I want you in here no more, Homer, uh... I got a lotta secrets I'd prefer to keep clandestine. Terrible, disturbing secrets."
"Just relax there, Waylon. We got a great thing goin' on. Now we can afford real bowls of pretzels instead of trompe-l'oeil-ing 'em on the bar."
"Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going."
"Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes..."
"Can't your old buddy Moe stop by with a list of questions from the Weekly World News? Number one: Sara, is it true you shoplifted a kayak?"
"No, I thought that we had a connection here, and we're out in the woods and everything, and... hey, forget it. I ain't gonna beg for it."
"Hey! Hey! Aw, that's great. Now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car."
"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
"All our lottery money, gone! If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes, and scoop him into the urinal trough at the gathering of the Juggalos."
"It all goes back to my acting days. I was auditioning for the role of Dr. Tad Winslow on the hit soap, ""It Never Ends."""
"Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire."
"Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters..."
"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
"What? I'm a monster, right? I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, periodically emerging to sue you."
"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
"Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide."
"Righ-- No, no. Wrong. Listen. While I'm on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. Then when the 10:15 train comes along..."
"Yeah, well, ya remember that time I tried to hang myself and the rope broke? Well, I sued the rope company and got a huge settlement... and a new rope!"
"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
"Name's Moe Szyslak. As a kid, I had roundworm. Heck, I was more worm than boy for a couple of years. I dabbled in Satanism, until I was asked to leave. Oh, uh, and one month I ate nothing but aquarium fish."
"Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?"
"Well, I gotta get home. There might be a telemarketer calling or something. I'll see you when you're old enough to drink, okay, Magpie."
"Yeah, funny thing, that. You said the end was comin', so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen and gave the money to charity. Now them orphans got new skip ropes, and I end every day smelling like eel. Cats are all over me. Thank you, though. You did me a solid."
"Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!"
"Oh, there she is, the birthday girl. Oh, your mommy tied a bow for you, huh. I'd better retie it -- the way you like it."
"Okay, Midge. You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy. But what can we do about it now? It's not like we can play the game over again."
"Boy, I love Valentine's Day. Stir a drop of JÃ¤germeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it ""Cupid's Ambrosia,"" and you can charge up the wazoo."
"Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas."
"Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it."
"Hi. How you folks doin'? I'm Moe. Or as the ladies like to call me, ""Hey you, behind the bushes."" Uh, is this thing on?"
"Geez, I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself Oh boy, I'm gonna start bawling, here."
"Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce ""joint."" I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?"
"Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth."
"Hey, Mag. Raggedy Andy over there has been giving you the button-eye. I'll get rid of him. All right, come on. Out you go."
"Ah, I put this up recently, and it's a good thing I did, 'cause it really illustrates my point. Yep, good ol' Swigmore U."
"Okay, now let's say I put a Lean Cuisine in a blender and I pour some beer on it. What do you call that?"
"Well... no... no... well... no... not a... lot... I... Gee, I'm sorry. I used to box you know, my brain's... Well, it's in and out."
"What? What? A bartender can't come by and say ""hi"" to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair."
"That is the stupidest story I ever heard, and I've read the entire Sweet Valley High series. Ha. I am sick of you drunks and your shaggy dog stories."
"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
"I'm sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children. It cuts through me like a dentist's drill. But no, no, that was funny, that was funny, takin' away my dignity like that. Ha ha ha."
"What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood."
"I had plans for that money too -- I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce! Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas, bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it..."
"Birthdays never meant squat to me. Then you offered to take me fishing, and like a stumblebum chump, I dared to hope. But you shattered my dreams like a Duff tallboy in a bar brawl. And you jammed the jagged neck right up my heart's butt."
"Look at me. It's supposed to be my big triumph and I'm standing in mud, fightin' with geese. Well, if I'm gonna fight, I might as well win."
"Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!"
"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns. And it begins, ""Dear Midge: you probably hate me by now, and if you don't, what's wrong which youse? But don't give up on men. Bart, Linda and the other one there need a Dad."""
"Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley. And me? I'm just a reliable source. Not ""sauce,"" ""source""! Source! ""S-A-U-R-C-E""!"
"And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough."
"I don't get this. This guy paints his noggin and you guys are ready to buy pants. Meanwhile, I been payin' for that billboard outside for a year now, and it's not yieldin' nothin'!"
"So all you mugs out there, be sure you don't take for granted the woman you love. Oh, and it's Mother's Day, so call your ma."
"Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending. I, when I first saw the movie Ironweed, I thought, ya know ""this is for me."" But now, well, I'm not so sure."
"Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierÃ³gi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars."
"Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!"
"I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula."
You are clearly too smart to be down here with these dingle-bells. I'm promotin' you to Toy Inspector. The rest of youse are laid off. Scram.
"Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn't have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety."
"Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't."
"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
"I knew that in order to win her love, I needed to get rid of the human garbage otherwise known as my best friends."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, now wait just a minute. One thing Moe Szyslak has never had is a partner. Nor a wife, a friend, a chum, a casual acquaintance, a pen pal, a parrot, a meaningful conversation, a brief hug or eye contact."
"All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?"
My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
"SITTIN' IN A ROCKING CHAIR / EATING BABY CRACK-ERS / TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, BANANA / A-B-C-D-E-F-G / WASH THOSE JUNE BUGS OFF OF ME"
"Well, I guess that wraps it up. Hey, there's one thing I don't get, though. When my face was crushed, why did it go back to my old face? I mean, shouldn't it have turned into some kind of third face that was different? Heh. Don't make no..."
"You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll?"
"Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!"
... So like a coward I let Homer take the rap for the whole scam. And now the only way to clear him is to turn myself in.
"That's good, no. Let it out. That's it. Let it out. Send me to Maude. That's it. Oh, here I come, baby. Oh, yeah."
"Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I've gotta know which of the two true faiths you represent."
"And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer."
