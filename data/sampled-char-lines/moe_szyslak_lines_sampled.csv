"Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses."
"I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula."
"Wait, wait, wait -- then that guy wasn't squeezin' my 'roids when he invited me to the Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?"
"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
"I see you're new to town -- maybe I could uh, show you around? I know a terrific tavern..."
"Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island."
"A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer 'em into giving you all their secrets."
"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."
"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
"Howya doin' there? Uh, your front door was locked, so, uh, rather than call or knock, I, uh, came down the chimbley there."
"The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher."
"Everyone relax, huh -- I know the Heimlich. I learned it a few years ago. It was nineteen ninety-seven, and ""Titanic"" was proving unsinkable at the box office..."
"Oh hey there, Liser. Just oiling the old door here. Finally silenced that mournful wail."
"Yeah, I wanna send her two dozen roses. And I wanna put something nice on the card, like, um, ""Renee, my treasure..."""
"Wow. Anyway, you don't think he could be at another bar, do you? Because I couldn't take that! I... uh... I-I just couldn't! I..."
Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
"And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time."
"Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn't have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety."
"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns. And it begins, ""Dear Midge: you probably hate me by now, and if you don't, what's wrong which youse? But don't give up on men. Bart, Linda and the other one there need a Dad."""
"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
And I was a lot happier before I knew Dame Edna was a man. A lot happier.
"I'm sorry, Marge, I'm sorry, but it was Christmas and we were under the mistletoe..."
She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.
"Okay, okay, uh... prepare to be kissed... here we go... giving in to my natural urges... okay, a few jumping jacks just to warm up..."
"Naw, naw, naw, we're goin' for the real thing. First class all the way. Come on, we can leave tonight."
"You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking ""attractive"" and ""desirable"". It's just so rare and refreshing."
"Just relax there, Waylon. We got a great thing goin' on. Now we can afford real bowls of pretzels instead of trompe-l'oeil-ing 'em on the bar."
"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
"They bought 'em a year ago, from the Mafia. It was the last of the family-owned teams."
Are you kiddin'? Homer's the one what wised us up to the sexy goin's on.
I'm a little worried. He usually stops in for an eye-opener on the way to work.
"Yeah, I figured out that the best way for me to get along with most people is to be kept behind a two foot chunk of solid oak."
"Yeah, I'd tell you guys I love you, but, uh, I don't wanna say it, and you don't wanna hear it..."
"I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better."
"Aw, that's the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that ""The Stinger."" They... they don't let you use that no more."
My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
"Shove off, puke-holes. Get out of there! These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies."
"I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys."
"I don't wanna say it's ugly, but PETA called and said we should kill this one."
"Yeah, that's probably a good one. Here, I got somethin' that might cheer ya up."
"Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin."
"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
"Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich."
"Oh, the fire has spread to this room full of valuables. And it's our duty to follow it."
"It's against hospital regulations, dammit! And Clive Dancer's just waitin' for me to slip up."
"Don't forget, Christmas is a wonderful time to take up alcoholism. You see your family all year round. The holidays are for your bartender."
"Shut up, or I'll ram a stool down your throat! Ah, nah, nah, no, I don't want that on the card... Well, lemme hear how it sounds... Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out. And charge it to my Players Club card... Maxed out?"
"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
"Ah man, he's makin' us look like a bunch of cheapskates. Whoa whoa. My rope came loose."
"No, you can still turn back! The point of no return is the whispered huddle."
"So, uh, what's a Princesses like you do all day, eh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treatin' you like crap?"
"I'm burnin' up, here. Ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. It's funny and it makes you think."
"Yeah, well, the part that's showin'. I guess you could have a lot of weird scars, or a fake ass, or somethin'."
"Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello?"
"... And if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell."
JUST ONCE I WISH CUPID / WOULD DRAW BACK HIS BOW / AND SHOOT ME A CUTIE / WHOSE STANDARDS ARE LOW...
"I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one."
"Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table."
"Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out."
"All I got is this old stuff here. Chateau Latour -- eighteen eighty-six? Oh, I should just throw this out."
"Uh-oh, looks like I gotta wing it a little bit here. The other day I ran into an Irishman. Oh really? No, O'Reilly."
"Hey there, well... it's my business partner, Mr. Smithers. Nice of you to drop by and not say nothin' that costs nobody no election."
"Well it don't matter no more, Midge. Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements."
"I ain't paid for Doris Kearns Goodwin in my life and I ain't gonna start now. Oh, that's some good Doris there."
"Oh, God. You smokers disgust me. Hey 'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis?"
"Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth."
"...So Sideshow Mel is drinkin' here all afternoon. When I show him the tab, he says he left his wallet in his other skirt, and he pays me with this!"
"Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser..."
I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl. He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.
"Well, I was gonna erase those two apostrophes and replace 'em with 'g's, but that's about it. So, you know, call anytime."
"Wow, no one's ever been happy in this place before. And when I started it was Moe's Ice Cream Carnival. Not good."
"Four guys, a chick and a noose. Just like the movies I like to watch."
"Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg."
"Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... uh, I ain't got nothin' clean to compare it to."
...because you should be on Broadway chargin' a hundred bucks a ticket! You're a natural talent!
"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
"Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You'll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!!"
"So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh?"
"Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot nothin' but trophy bucks, huh?"
Now I'm thinkin' about ping-pong... a very fast chess game... a snappy David Mamet play...
"Aw, your ""teef"" hurt, huh? Your ""teef"" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! You hear me? I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' ""sodie, too!"""
"Really? Hot damn! All right. Don't eat nothin' for the next three days, 'cause I'm takin' you out for a steak the size of a toilet seat!"
"So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now."
"Oh my God -- we're sealed in! Hey, nobody breathe my air -- get your own!"
"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
"Ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now."
"Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I, uh... what was the third thing you said?"
"Well, we hated being mad at ya, Homer, so we decided to make things right."
"All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips..."
"Whoa, check that out! / Stuff is getting' done! / Look at them renovations! / And... finished!"
It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin' restless.
"So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable."
It's so nice to be with someone who can't understand the horrible things I say.
"Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway."
"Thanks, Marge... Know-it-all bitch. Oh, uh, did I mention there was a mistake at the front desk?"
