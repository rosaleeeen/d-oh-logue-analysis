Oh indeed. Your mother was as fine a student as you.
...and that ugly customer was the last Indonesian Rhino on earth.
"We can't continue on like this, trying to build a private relationship in public -- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb."
Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
"All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!"
"Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
"Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?"
I've got it! What are you doing? Give me that phone.
"And she trashed my bar! Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her."
"Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?"
"Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?"
"Surprised? Me, C. Montgomery Burns, locked up like an animal."
"And don't forget, federal law mandates that we consider alcohol a drug."
"Shove off, puke-holes. Get out of there! These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies."
"Let's get started. First I'd like to announce that thanks to the magic of Disney Animatronics, Strom Thurmond will live another hundred years."
This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable behavior.
"Don't be nervous, Ned. You've practiced this so many times in the shower."
"Not you. Never you. And due to budget cuts, until Edna comes back, I have no choice but to merge the school's two fourth-grade classes."
"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
"Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough."
One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!
...Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.
"Welcome to Career Day. Here to tell you about his job is Bart's friend's Dad, Kirk Van Houten."
They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!
"Now let us ""download"" the holy ""tweet"" of the Lord."
"When we were kids, our dads used to get drunk and make us fight each other."
"Oh sure, Marge. Just like ""blind Bart,"" ""wheelchair Bart,"" ""pregnant Bart"" and my personal favorite, ""railroad spike through head Bart."""
I'm afraid I already swallowed it while you were talking.
"Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce ""joint."" I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?"
The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
"Well, this is turning out to be a total waste of time."
"So children, put down your answer sheet and drop that number two!"
"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
I was not bald! My fontanel was covered by lanugo!
"Guys, after all the years I've given you advice, now I need a little advice from you."
"No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think."
"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
"Great at the chewin', not so hot at the swallowing."
"If Boner here is gettin' cuts, I want 'em too."
"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
"Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie."
"Certainly. Oh, it was a beautiful day. The sun was shining. I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys."
"No, you fool. 'Tis I, Burns! Now come with me."
"And entering the ring, America's original vainglorious bastard... Glamorous Godfrey!"
"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
"Total disaster. Complete bomb. Utter failure. Uh, dream I painted. And in this economy a man needs to find new customers while keeping his old best friends. So, whaddaya say?"
...Then we light a match...And FWOOOF! We start a new life in Hawaii.
"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
"Whoa, fellas, that is not acceptable. This is a nuclear plant."
These are the people in my life I could never find time for because I was too busy working.
"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
"Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind."
"It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!"
"Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly. Could I have another straitjacket?"
"Not now, Smithers. I've got an empire to rebuild, and the person who's going to help me is... that girl!"
"Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done. I accept that I killed my mother. My whole life she's belittled me! Maybe deep down... I'm glad."
And this Slinky... these things are fun for about two seconds.
Nonsense! Just because a man can't see or hold his hand steady doesn't make him any less of a marksman.
"How much to have Bart crank-call me? That would be hilarious. Eh, that's just me, though. You know, I love to laugh."
"Aw, you're shivering, are you cold? Where you goin', Marge?"
"Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed. Don't hide your light in a smoky back room, making dusty old decisions."
"Though not now, because I have a series of important meetings."
"Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon."
This building's got ninety-eight floors! And I'm goin' down to P-6! P-6!
"The boys at the Diners Club will think I've gone quite mad. Oh, and I'll have that roadster in the corner as well."
Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
"Come on, Smithers. Let's go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for ""Little Monty,"" of course."
"Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?"
Can't. I'm not really a God. I was just acting crazy to get out of jury duty.
"...so that's how I was outfoxed by a little girl and her half-wit companion. When my beautiful stadium was declared a bee sanctuary, and I had to take a third-quarter writedown of eight hundred four million dollars."
"Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit. Perhaps I could sell him a little oil."
"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
"Okay, kids. Otto's in charge. Remember, Otto, we're trusting you with our greatest natural resource, the school bus."
MS. KRABAPPEL / A SAD PRINCIPAL / IS DESPERATE AND NEEDY / IF YOU COME HOME / I WON'T DIE ALONE / AND THAT'S WHAT I'D PREFER...
"Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
"And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns."
"Yes, Seamus. Ninety minutes of watching a man drink in a bathtub."
We did twenty takes and that was the best one.
"Oh, that's right. I have his memories because I ate his brain."
"Precisely the type of wordplay I seek to discourage. ""New wood."" Now, please welcome your new gym teacher: Coach Krupts!"
"Bart, so good to see you! I have a little favor to ask you."
"In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music..."
"You know, lighthearted. Fancy free. ""Mothers lock up your daughters, Smithers is on the town!"""
"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
"Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship."
"A shreda what? Uh, sorry, I was countin' the cocktail radishes."
"Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?"
There's something I've wanted to say to you for a long time. Am I a good principal?
"Uh, I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I... I think they could start slacking at any moment."
"Another scoop. Sara Sloane to attend girl-on-girl book club. Moe, you loveable loser, you just made yourself five dollars!"
"We've got the ""how"" , and we've got the ""who"" , but we don't have the ""why."""
"All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?"
"Let's see. ""Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
"No, I'm not kidding. I am gonna sit right here and miss church. You just watch."
"Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
"Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."""
Flawless logic. But I am going to have to ask you to speak a few phrases to verify your fluency.
"Oh man, stakeouts are so boring. I wish I had something to look at."
"Steal my plant will you? By the time you wake up, you'll be walled inside my mausoleum forever!"
"Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?"
... So like a coward I let Homer take the rap for the whole scam. And now the only way to clear him is to turn myself in.
"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
"Now if you can get it through your bug-addled brain, jam that second mephitic clod-hopper of yours on the right doo-dad! Now pump those scrawny chicken legs, you stuporous funker!"
"Homer, do somethin' about your dad. He's casting a pall over this grim dungeon full of losers."
"Us... a team? As the salad said to the soup, ""I'm all mixed up."""
"Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
"Now, wait a minute. Dirty words you can spell on your calculator is a very important subject."
"""So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them... Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the Earth. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between God and man."" Thank you."
Mmmm. This dessert is exquisite. What do you call it?
For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
"Over, under, in and out, that's what shoe tying's all about."
"Don't give me that kiss of death, you black widow!"
This town cared more for a soulless piece of granite than for me! I don't have a friend in the world.
Ahh. Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.
"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
Now let's raise the roof for the bland informative rap of M. C. Safety and the Caution Crew!
"I ain't paid for Doris Kearns Goodwin in my life and I ain't gonna start now. Oh, that's some good Doris there."
"What? What? A bartender can't come by and say ""hi"" to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair."
"Oh, this novelty foam hand is ludicrously oversized. Go swap it for a smaller one."
"Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
"Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy."
A satellite? What do we do? What do we do?
"Sixty Minutes -- Morley Safer has questionable pants fold -- ""The L Word"" -- used the ""L"" word."
"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
Now I'm thinkin' about ping-pong... a very fast chess game... a snappy David Mamet play...
"I said, I'm lop-shouldered! And I have been since I was hung by my armpits in a North Vietnamese prison!"
"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
"Yeah, I really miss the old guy. It was all I could do to put on his jewels."
Excuse me. I'm supposed to stand in your store window and breastfeed Bilbo Baggins.
"And the Godfather's playing with his grandson, see. So he sticks an orange in his mouth, like this."
"Wow. I can't believe this, Simon. Simon? Huh. Was he really here, or was it just my imagination?"
"Okay, we won't tell no one about that. Now let's see, what else can we do? We can't tickle Elmo no more."
"This is absurd. I did not have relations in that closet. And the fact is, I haven't... ...uh..."
They will be playing Stars and Stripes Forever -- hopefully not forever.
Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / MADE IT RUN / MADE IT RACE AGAINST TIME/ ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / NOW IT'S DONE / BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME./ HALF A MILLION BOOTS WENT SLOGGING THROUGH HELL / I WAS THE KID WITH THE DRUM.
Um... She's so beautiful. It makes my heart take wing!
"What do you say, son? You keep our secret and some other student can inherit your gloomy, windblown future."
Why did I advertise my drink specials in Scientific American?
"And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons."
I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.
Any of these islands would make a fine new country.
"Damage waiver, check. Return with full tank of gas, check."
"Hey, hey, what are you laughin' at? What? Oh, oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well children, I can't help that!"
"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
"Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play."
"Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft."
I'm an imposter. That man is the real Seymour Skinner.
"Hey, speaking of stats, I'm none too pleased about your ratio of ""seats occupied"" to ""beers ordered."""
"Smithers, what's going on? How dare you interrupt my lime rickey? State your business."
Thank God there's no alcohol in this bar or this place would really go up.
"Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser..."
"Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds."
The whole town is laughing at me behind my back. I guess you're the only real friend I have.
Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
"Uh, this here poem is called ""Elevator Capacity."" ""Elevator capacity twenty-four hundred pounds. Inspection Certificate available in hotel manager's office..."""
Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
"Grab your scripts, people! We open in twenty minutes! Break a leg!"
"Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!"
"When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it."
"Okay, Homer, he's tired! He's tired! Now's your chance! Nudge him! Nudge him!"
"Possibly, but I can't risk Superintendent Chalmers finding out about--"
"I've made the calls. I'm going to have Elon Musk killed. And I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend."
"Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?"
That's great. Now what do you say we do some regional duck pin bowling?
I can't believe I'm on the town with Glamorous Godfrey himself! Tell me of your epic battle with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.
And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
"Well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
Hear that? The percolations are imminent! No need to come in! Cease your ingress!
"And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets."
"Oh, me, me, me ""I need all the attention just because it's my party, eh!"""
"But wait, perhaps I'm being too hasty. You are highly skilled... at goofing off!"
"No, sorry. My diamonds are going to be retro-morphed into coal... the most valuable substance on earth. I know. I'll send you to Yale, with the Monty Burns Scholarship."
"Really? Oh. Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks."
"Oh God, here it comes -- time-share pitch. Well I got bad credit, so the joke's on you!"
"Midge, the suit got a little mussed up. I gotta ask ya... is it noticeable?"
That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It'll all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.
"Hold on, I'll check. Ah, is, I.P. Freely here? Hey everybody, I.P. Freely?"
"Well, I do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... Now, do you have any pets?"
"It's a comic strip I do called ""Bumble and Grumble."" Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son."
"Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!"
Ya... you're right. That's the kind of thing that would haunt you.
"For one sweet summer, I was a true gentleman. As a result of which, Krabappel was lettin' me do her."
"Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better."
"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
It has come to my attention that you lunch-bagging wage-lizards are robbing me blind!
"Okay boys, this is it. The end of this sinful little suburb."
"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble.
"Okay, she said she'd be here at exactly eight o'clock."
"Someone must've, uh, put it in my bag. They do that, you know. They're always putting things in my bag!"
I'm working on my magic act for the Faculty Follies. But right now I don't feel much like follying.
"Yes, I know what that means -- I've learned so much today! This is my school and I'm throwing out the test!"
"Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn."
"Well, Homer's gone. Let's all go into our suspended state till he gets back."
"Shut up, you! Take one last look at the sun, Springfield."
"Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates."
"Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye."
"Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar."
"Lisa, the President of Harvard would like a word with you."
"What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye..."
And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put coins in it. Whatever you like.
"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
"Your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of America's only losing war."
"So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh?"
Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
"Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out. So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin."
"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
"Attention. This is an emergency broadcast. All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total -- Hey, gimme that."
"Oh, I wish. You see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
"Look, I like Moe's the way it is, all right? And I ain't changin' it for any dame, skirt, Susie-Q, or face-macer."
"It's already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the NeNe. And it has nasty plans for the booby, the titmouse, the woodcock, and the titpecker."
"Oh, right. I was thinking of another thing I got goin'."
"Ah, these, aah, they're just painted on, there. Your choices are beer and, ah... egg soakin's."
"We-we-we switch clothes with them, leave 'em in the bar. Then we pour some brandy around. Like so..."
"Okay, when I call your name, ah, you say present, or here. No, say present. Anita Bath?"
"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe... I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.
"Seven o'clock Friday night, Mother. Time for our weekly silhouette."
"Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. Sears catalog."
"Well, I hope you've all learned something from Nelson's headstrongedness. Now from now on..."
We could make it if we took Mr. Burns's helicopter.
"No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece."
"So Marge, uh... Homer's been gone a whole week, huh? In an unrelated matter, I just put on cologne and shaved my knuckles."
"Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
"No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
"In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just don't like the monster I've become."
"Say Homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
That means it worked. No one ever remembers. That's why I made this video to explain the process.
"We clashed lances on the Champs de Mars, and I have been bested. The plant is yours. Treat her well."
"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
"I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!"
"Oof. Well, he didn't put up much of a fight. Uh, why don't you pick one for me?"
"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
I like you newsies. You really lap up the sauce.
"Well, it, it, uh... took place in a country we teach about."
"No, if... if the state finds out they'll shut us down!"
"Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure?"
"Yes. Now I'd like to ask each child to pair up with a buddy, so no one gets lost."
"And now, I want you to meet the guy who's gonna help bring Moe's into the twentieth century."
"I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes... I believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating your shorts."
"Oh, there's nothing like canceling an employee drug plan to make one feel so at peace with the universe."
"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
"Yes, feel their hatred. It makes you strong, powerful... alive!"
"I'm so sick of you, Smithers. Your toadying, your complete agreeability, your gasping on the floor... Wha?!"
"...for creating a furry robotic friend who provides comfort when humans fail to, which they will, trust me."
Remember me? Twenty-five years ago you said I was too ugly to play Dr. Tad Winslow!
"And score with his wife every night. Hey, how ya doin', kid? Nice to see ya."
Would you ever consider throwing your wig back into the ring?
"Go back to your tenements, where the O'Briens live next to the Goldbergs, who rub elbows with Antonellis, and the only thing you have in common is the squalor of your chamber pot. Oh how I hate you! Bye-bye."
Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
Everybody is goin' to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
"Hey, you twos can go work for the Easter Bunny!"
"Ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
"Who will spot the playful abalone? The mighty winkle? I think it might be you, Sherri!"
"Uh, there is an added bonus -- some of the revenue can go to help our under-funded public schools!"
"Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy."
Why are these numbers so high? Why is that red light flashing?
"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa. She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own."
"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
"So uh, would you like to cut one? I mean a rug. Oh God, I always say the wrong thing."
Of course you do. You can lift my wiper any day.
"Flanders to God, Flanders to God! Get off your cloud and save my Todd."
"I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of ""Rubber v. Glue"" and reaffirmed by ""I Know You Are v. What Am I."""
Not the smarty-pants answer. Where's the drama in your life?
"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all."
"I see. Well, what if I cover you all with... a cube of bulletproof plexi-glass!"
"No, of course not! I don't know why girls are worse."
Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
"Oh, so you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
Balderdash. I'll just stick my head right in and --
"Y'know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
"Don't worry, Mother. I have your eye balm in my man-purse right here."
"Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door."
"Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink?"
"The eggs are supposed to be tossed between students, not at the principal. Once more and hurl!"
"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.

"Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight."
"Smithers, I'm a proud fellow, and it's not easy for me to admit defeat. But I know just the thing to make me feel better -- shopping!"

"All right, good. Let's dig... That's right, dig some more... Oh, we make quite a duo: Burns and associate. No, no, what am I thinking? Burns and... teammate."
"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."

Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.

You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.

"Look, if you want me to turn, just point. That w..."
"Homer, did you hear that? She called me handsome. Me. It's like I've gone to heaven... Wait a minute. I died on the operating table, didn't I?"
"Okay, well I'll do a soliloquy too. Note to self: ""Kill that kid."""
"It'll, uh, be a few minutes. So, what brings you to my home?"
"Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in the hospital who wants you to win this game. I know because I crippled him myself to inspire you."

"Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I can't be everywhere at once."
"Now remember, these pools can be dangerous, so everyone pick a buddy."

"Finally, this town will have a real claim to fame."
"Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question. We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in, ah... you know, one of them loser countries."

"You know what they say: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""
"Bart, I'm very impressed at the independent learning you've displayed here."
"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
"Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses."
Wait a minute. I'm at work. Ya gotta pay for it.
"All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips..."
"No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet."

"A toast, to our enigmatic new protector -- who certainly isn't me! Smithers, wink my eye!"

"So, from now on our cafeteria will only serve... delicious ""Stuffwich's"" heroes, hoagies, and torpedoes."

"I'd been called ugly, pug ugly, fugly, pug fugly, but never ugly ugly."
"You, Smithers? Oh no, my dear friend, I've planned a far greater reward for you. When I pass on, you shall be buried alive with me."
"Oh, that's it, baby. All for Moe. Oh, yeah. Work the slot. Show me the package."
You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.
