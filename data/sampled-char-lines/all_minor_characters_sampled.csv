I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!

"Well children, I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold?"
"Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby."
"Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals..."
"And to think, Smithers -- you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. ""Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."""
The students will do anything she says. She's captured their imagination like a bright piece of construction paper.
"Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--"
"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."
"Well, I... you see... it's just is it a crime to want nice things? And then to steal them from a public museum where any gum-chewing monkey in a Tufts University jacket can gawk at them? I think not!"
"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"

"Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You'll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!!"
"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
"Darn right, I'm the boss. Don't forget, I can send you back where you came from... college boy."
"All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... twelve goats."
"A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello?"
"Howya doin' there? Uh, your front door was locked, so, uh, rather than call or knock, I, uh, came down the chimbley there."
"Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the ""trouble ball"" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers."
You're right. We're getting screwed! There must be something I can do about this. Wait! Yes! I think I know just the thing!
"So, uh, what's a Princesses like you do all day, eh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treatin' you like crap?"
"Although this millennium is still young, I feel it is time to award this giant trophy paid for with your healthcare cuts..."
"I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls."

"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
I'm a little worried. He usually stops in for an eye-opener on the way to work.
Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!
"I never tire of that. Uh, one other announcement, at the end of the month we'll be participating in the Vice-President's Assessment Test."
"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
"""Prisoner 24601""... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I'd see the old girl again."
"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
"Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork. Not some hot dog admissions officer playing by his own rules."
"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
"... And if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell."
"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
"Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire..."
"Hey there, Mr. Burns! For our half hour I thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
"Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in."
"Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg."
"How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""?"
"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
"Oh, God. You smokers disgust me. Hey 'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis?"
"We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance."
"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
"Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich."
Plus our last bake sale was a disaster. People took bites without buying the cookies.
...because you should be on Broadway chargin' a hundred bucks a ticket! You're a natural talent!
"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns. And it begins, ""Dear Midge: you probably hate me by now, and if you don't, what's wrong which youse? But don't give up on men. Bart, Linda and the other one there need a Dad."""
"Whoa, check that out! / Stuff is getting' done! / Look at them renovations! / And... finished!"
"When Edna Met Seymour... ""Ghost Willie""... ""Killing Seymour's Mother""... ""The Principal Who Sold A Screenplay""..."
"Sir, if we let these hill folk into our school, our test scores would drop so low, we'd lose all federal funding."
"Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry."
"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
"Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills."
"I don't wanna say it's ugly, but PETA called and said we should kill this one."
"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
"Yeah, well, the part that's showin'. I guess you could have a lot of weird scars, or a fake ass, or somethin'."
"So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable."
"Hmm. So mother was right -- it was my fault. Go ahead, water it down some more."
"Simpson, I worked here for three-score and twain. That's sixty-two years in the ""New English"". Now, come with me, I want to show you something."
"The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher."

"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
"Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
"I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch ""yes."""
"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
"Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?"
"Well, we hated being mad at ya, Homer, so we decided to make things right."
"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
Welcome to the American dream: a billionaire using public funds to construct a private playground for the rich and powerful.
"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
"THEN I DOUBT YOU'LL LIKE NED FLANDERS / OR HIS CREEPY LITTLE OFFSPRING, ROD AND TODD..."
"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
"Oh, excellent. Not only are the trains now running on time, they're running on metric time."
No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese Needle Snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards.
"Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth."
He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
Good Lord! That canary was supposed to be my pigeon. I need to find a patsy quick!
"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
"Uh-oh, looks like I gotta wing it a little bit here. The other day I ran into an Irishman. Oh really? No, O'Reilly."
"It's against hospital regulations, dammit! And Clive Dancer's just waitin' for me to slip up."
Now let's raise the roof for the bland informative rap of M. C. Safety and the Caution Crew!
"Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one!"
"Well, that broke the ice. Now, any man who lives till noon tomorrow shall win his freedom."
She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.
"If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold."
"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
"Mr. Simpson, I dread the day when a hundred thousand dollars isn't worth groveling for."
"I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice."
"Workers, please! There'll be time for the frozen pudding wagon later! You still owe me ten more Iroquois twists!"
"Think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver. If you don't give the driver all the money, he'll drive you over a cliff. It's just common sense. Furthermore, rich people feel things more deeply than the common man."
"Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back."
"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
"I'm sorry, Marge, I'm sorry, but it was Christmas and we were under the mistletoe..."
"Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot nothin' but trophy bucks, huh?"
"If you hand over the concert hall to me, I'll assume the debt and all of your problems will disappear."
"Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway."
"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin' restless.
"Naw, naw, naw, we're goin' for the real thing. First class all the way. Come on, we can leave tonight."
"Oh, the fire has spread to this room full of valuables. And it's our duty to follow it."
STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!

"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
"You know, Homer's givin' it the old bible college try. Maybe I should have dialed down the Doubting Thomas."
Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
"Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
Now I'm thinkin' about ping-pong... a very fast chess game... a snappy David Mamet play...
"Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone."
"No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death."
"Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair."
"If we didn't get them back by five, we'd be charged for the extra day."
"They bought 'em a year ago, from the Mafia. It was the last of the family-owned teams."
"After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way. I feel like celebrating. I..."
"And what book is that? The Ape Who Wanted A Big Bonus? Stop wasting my time, you corn-fed man-cow."
"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
"Really? Hot damn! All right. Don't eat nothin' for the next three days, 'cause I'm takin' you out for a steak the size of a toilet seat!"
"Lord, give me guidance. That's right, the guidance department -- detention room. Thank you, Mrs. Lord."
"Everyone relax, huh -- I know the Heimlich. I learned it a few years ago. It was nineteen ninety-seven, and ""Titanic"" was proving unsinkable at the box office..."
"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
"Oh? Well, I've always admired your tart honesty and ability to be personally offended by broad social trends."
"And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time."
"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
"Bart, you wouldn't happen to know what sort of candy your Aunt Patty likes, would you?"
"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
"Hey there, well... it's my business partner, Mr. Smithers. Nice of you to drop by and not say nothin' that costs nobody no election."
"I'm afraid that due to funding cuts, we've had to sell the Science Department skeleton and replace it with this Halloween costume."
My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
"I'm burnin' up, here. Ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. It's funny and it makes you think."
"Thanks, Marge... Know-it-all bitch. Oh, uh, did I mention there was a mistake at the front desk?"
It's so nice to be with someone who can't understand the horrible things I say.
"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
"Why that's a fabulous idea. Anything else you'd like? How about real lead in the radiation shields? Urinal cakes maybe? Smithers, throw this at him."
"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
"Wow. Anyway, you don't think he could be at another bar, do you? Because I couldn't take that! I... uh... I-I just couldn't! I..."
"Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat."
"""Please excuse my handwriting. I busted whichever hand it is I write with. Signed, Mrs. Simpson."" You were right to be suspicious, Edna. To the crime lab."
"Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there."
"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
"I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in."
"Now, ah, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I think the kids will follow it to Tuesday."
"Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
"Just relax there, Waylon. We got a great thing goin' on. Now we can afford real bowls of pretzels instead of trompe-l'oeil-ing 'em on the bar."
"Smithers, years ago, I blew the chance to buy Picasso's ""Guernica"" for a song. Luckily, that song was ""White Christmas,"" and by hanging onto it, I made billions."
"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
"Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once-in-a-lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs."
"The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La BohÃ¨me. I want you to sing the lead."
"We'll just see about that-- Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake-- Nope. It's airtight."
"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
"Yes, well, while I disagree with your T-shirt's assertion, I do encourage anything that raises glacier awareness. Busward to adventure!"
"Illinois! Eighteen fifty-eight! Please welcome, here to debate the important issues of the day, Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln!"
"Yeah, I'd tell you guys I love you, but, uh, I don't wanna say it, and you don't wanna hear it..."
"For your information, I am not a loser! I'm a successful principal who paints houses in the summertime."
"Aw, your ""teef"" hurt, huh? Your ""teef"" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! You hear me? I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' ""sodie, too!"""
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you, without using the letter ""E,"" you can keep your job."
"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
"Okay, it's time to win the love of these hateful morons. Step one: amass a vast media empire."
"Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around."
"Young man, the school dress code specifically forbids the wearing of earrings... unless you're of gypsy extraction."
"So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now."
"I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one."
"Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our American plant ever did."
"Simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!"
"Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times?"
"Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser..."
"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
"Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. Release the balloon."
"I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths."
"Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques."
No. It's better that they hear it from me. I'll tell them the truth in the simplest way I know how.
It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
"Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother."
"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
"Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh."
"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
"Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor."
"Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses."
"Well, if you took ""space case"" on a date... and brought me to chaperone along with her mother..."
"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl. He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.
"I am pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. What's the name of this gastropod?"
"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
"Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug!"
"Because of my svelte physique, I was able to fit in a narrow air pocket."
"...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful."
"Marge, Homer, this is Brody and Madison McKenna. Bart has been sharing a desk with their daughter Nikki."
"Well, if we can't get into Sundance, would you like to check out its alternative cousin, Slam Dance?"
Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
"Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone."
"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
"If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world."
"We replaced the fanfare with classical music, and instead of chasing a rabbit the dogs chase a diploma."
"Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
"All I got is this old stuff here. Chateau Latour -- eighteen eighty-six? Oh, I should just throw this out."
"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
"I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys."
"This entire plant is in his name -- so when they come to put C. M. Burns in jail, it's the canary that does the time."
"Aw, that's the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that ""The Stinger."" They... they don't let you use that no more."
"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
"He's got them eating out of his hand. And to think you doubted him, Smithers."
"I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you would find in any well-maintained nuclear facility? Or, for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals."
"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
"Oh yes. And this must be your lovely wife... ... ""Marge."" And look at little... ... ""Lisa"". Why, she's growing like a weed. And this must be... ... ""Brat""."
"Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello?"
"The electric chair is on, eh? Then the old prison has been getting free electricity for thirty years. I'll put a stop to that."
"Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
"But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ooh, delightfully devilish, Seymour."
"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
"""Two and Two are Four, Four and Four are Eight, Eight and Eight are Sixteen..."""
"I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time."
"Ah, yes. Uh, take a good look at him, Nelson, cause that's where you're headed."
"I'm here to tell you about a field trip so amazing we've put ""sign here"" stickers on the permission slips."
"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."
"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
"Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong?"
"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
"Please, calm down, everyone! You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity... to, uh, initiate a dialogue... that would, uh, create a teachable moment... uh, something something buzz word, I got nothing."
"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
"Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out."
"That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers. A real scrapper. A self-made man like me. Bring this Grimes fellow to me. I want to make him my executive vice president."
"May I interest you in a Jello brick, Sir? There's a grape in the center."
"Ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now."
"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
"Edna Krabappel, will you marry me? Now I must warn you, two months' salary only bought me the ring box."
"Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island."
"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
"It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
"Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play."
"So, let's see how my burly-bottomed ball-handlers are faring. Smithers, we're leading two to nothing! Run out the clock, boys. Run out the clock..."
"Ah, nineteen ninety-five. A fine year for Camrys. No one would ever guess you spent three months in a lake."
"A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley."
"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
"Would you like to be the first to take a tour of the plant, Li'l Lisa?"
"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
"Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut."
"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
How come you always run out of tardy slips before you run out of permission slips?
"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
"I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish, a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch."
"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
"""Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..."" I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over."
"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
"I ain't paid for Doris Kearns Goodwin in my life and I ain't gonna start now. Oh, that's some good Doris there."
"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
"I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
"I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better."
I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
"Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner in exchange for a few tales of the golden age of professional grappling."
"Well, it looks like you've made a new fan. It'd be a shame to let him down..."
"Four guys, a chick and a noose. Just like the movies I like to watch."
"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
AND PURPLE AND WHITE AND PINK AND ORANGE / AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH...
"Oh my God -- we're sealed in! Hey, nobody breathe my air -- get your own!"
"...So Sideshow Mel is drinkin' here all afternoon. When I show him the tab, he says he left his wallet in his other skirt, and he pays me with this!"
"Try to take my eggs will you? Well, this rooster has a beak! A beak which calls out death-a-doodle-doo!"
"My older brother was trampled by a horse, my sister died of a poisoned potato, my twin was shot, that girl was stabbed, he ate another poisoned potato, spontaneous combustion, fell down a well, potato, potato, and impaled on the Chrysler Building."
"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
"Hmmm, I haven't seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon. Well, William, another school year gone by."
"Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes."
"At five-fifteen an hour, it would take an eternity to make my fortune back -- and FICA wasn't helping."
"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
"Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table."
"Mr. Szyslak, what name did the defendant ask for when he called you at your bar?"
"Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I, uh... what was the third thing you said?"
"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
"Shut up, or I'll ram a stool down your throat! Ah, nah, nah, no, I don't want that on the card... Well, lemme hear how it sounds... Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out. And charge it to my Players Club card... Maxed out?"
Are you kiddin'? Homer's the one what wised us up to the sexy goin's on.
"Ah man, he's makin' us look like a bunch of cheapskates. Whoa whoa. My rope came loose."
"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
"It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!"
"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."
For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
And I was a lot happier before I knew Dame Edna was a man. A lot happier.
"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
"Listen, SeÃ±or Spielbergo. I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler."
"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
"Oh, don't congratulate me, congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks... as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent of the proceeds."
"A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer 'em into giving you all their secrets."
"Attention everyone. Please welcome our Valedictorian, Lisa Simpson. She will be attending Yale...I mean, Hot Dog on a Stick Management Camp."
"Oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
"Wait, wait, wait -- then that guy wasn't squeezin' my 'roids when he invited me to the Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?"
