No team? I guess I just have to give you all an hour of free play.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
"You did it, Nibbles. Now chew through my ball sack."
"Bart, you and the other perfect-scoring ""Superstars"" are exempt from taking the actual test today."
"Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen. You're being swept under the rug for the Superintendent's visit. Enjoy!"
"Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today."
"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
"Eh, it's not really a party town. Though if I remember correctly, they occasionally hold a function called Mardi... something."
"That's not true. I can buy a new pair. No, I can't. I needed those. I really did."
"Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions."
Because we do our sleuthing in Mother's Nissan Quest Minivan.
Time to do what I've never done as principal: something.
"Ah... oh, that isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams."
"Dying alone, huh? Terrible fate to befall any woman -- ice-age or modern-day."
"...annnd that concludes tonight's auction, which has raised a school record one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars!"
How come you always run out of tardy slips before you run out of permission slips?
Mm hm. We even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
"I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths."
"If you think it's so easy to handle Bart Simpson, why don't you do it yourself?!"
Out of gas! But how?! I put a dollar in this morning and we've only driven ninety cents.
Somebody put a torch to these permanent records! Quickly now.
I'm an imposter. That man is the real Seymour Skinner.
"Mother, I have work to do. Well, it's work if they pay you! They say they're going to!"
"Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back."
Do you think there's a place in the hip-hop world for a forty-something elementary school administrator?
"Well, that would be the complete dozen... All right. Rather than tempt fate, I'll move along now."
"Remember this moment, people. Eighty past two on April forty-seventh. It's the dawn of an enlightened Springfield."
Wheel him out quietly. It's best the children don't see him.
"The best photographs, or ""photos"", will be prominently displayed in the school lobby all year long."
"Hmm. Looks like you've already got an enemy, Chief. Y'know, folks 'round here don't much care for law and order types."
"All right, now we can get back on the bus and on..."
"Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?"
I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now.
It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
She's the only Springfield Elementary alum ever to advance to the Ivy League!
"Young man, the only thing we exchanged for you is our national dignity."
"I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes?"
"Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there."
"I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch ""yes."""
"Why is it that women ""appear"" to be worse at math then men? What is the source of this ""illusion?"" Or, as I call it, ""the biggest lie ever told."""
"Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice."
"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."
"Well, I guess we're gonna need a new student body president."
"Now remember, these pools can be dangerous, so everyone pick a buddy."
And they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster to play Fallout Boy.
"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
"Lisa, I have to run home. I need you to keep an eye on the dance."
"You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of."
"And finally, effective immediately, I'm overturning this school's ban on dancing."
"Willie, you're no stranger to the inner-workings of the female mind."
...spreading the rumor that today's lunch would be served by a naked lady...
"Lisa, student government is meaningless. Look at your constitution. It's written on the back of a placemat."
"Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores."
"There is only one class left, but it happens to be the ""coolest"" one of all."
"That's odd. I don't have a secretary, or an intercom. But send him in."
"Then I'm afraid these ""Wet Ones"" will have to do the job."
I'll handle this. Simpson! I'm giving you 'til the count of three to come out. One... two... three. I've done all I can do.
"We're low on funding, so Ralph Wiggum will be standing in as your lectern."
"No, no there's no need for that... it's already named after me."
"Oh, Springfield Elementary! I will have you back again! After all, tomorrow is another school day!"
"Willie, please. The children want to pick on someone their own size."
"Well, it seems someone was riding the giant tortoise naked."
"I'm so sorry. Lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her."
One of our brightest and most meddlesome students called this meeting... somehow... to discuss an urgent menu matter. Lisa?
"A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello?"
"I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I'm a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!!"
"Children, I hope we all have a pleasant and orderly day here at ""Satan's Anvil."" No one knows why the early settlers called it that, and I suppose we never will."
"Hey, I want the ""check engine"" light on my dashboard to shut off, but that ain't gonna happen."
"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
"Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography, and math. But ah, you're doing quite well in Home-Ec."
Which of you boys hurled Lisa Simpson's backpack through my window?
"Uh, something else about me is that I'm thinking of becoming an excellent cook."
"Forget grades! With the right subject, you could be a great filmmaker. What comes to mind when you think of drama?"
It's the backseat of my Merkur. There's thirty-seven cents in the coin caddy. And stay out of my diary!
"Yes, quite so. As you can see, I'm holding a big number two in my hands, enjoying the weight and feel of it."
I'd like you to give this note to Edna when you get back to class. I don't think I have to tell you it's for her eyes only.
"Martin Prince was known by many names: Martin Priss, Martin Princess, Fartin' Prince, Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer..."
"We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room."
"Bart, open this door now -- or I will jiggle the handle indefinitely!"
We've been invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level.
"All right, Martin. For your community service, you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs."
"A conjunction meaning ""in the event that"" or ""on condition that."""
"Mmm... heck of a school. Weren't you at Brown, Otto?"
Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
"Bart, because of your sister's restraining order, there is no place in this school you can legally occupy, without violating your order. Observe."
You're not made of stone... a brick and you're... made of stone...
"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
"Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School."
"Hello, kids. Everything above the board here? Good. Play friendly, children."
"I didn't burn down the school. It was the butterfly, I tell you! The butterfly!"
"Sorry, kids, the trip to Albany is off, and there's to be no more recycling."
"Now, you keep asking me that. And I keep telling you, over there."
Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
"Brilliant plan to remove all the underperformers for test day, sir."
"There's no hope for you, Simpson. You'll be locked in detention until you graduate to the penal system."
"I hope you all enjoy your ride to and tour of the Springfield Shopper Newspaper. Groundskeeper Willie and I will stay behind to remove all traces of asbestos and the word ""evolution"" from our school."
I think what she would treasure most is a gift bought through honest effort. Because...
"How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something."
"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
