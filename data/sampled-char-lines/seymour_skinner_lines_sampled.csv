"Well, if we can't get into Sundance, would you like to check out its alternative cousin, Slam Dance?"
"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
"Well children, I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold?"
"Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone."
"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
"Ah, nineteen ninety-five. A fine year for Camrys. No one would ever guess you spent three months in a lake."
"Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother."
"I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time."
"Oh, excellent. Not only are the trains now running on time, they're running on metric time."
I'll deal with your insubordinate wordplay later. My first duty is to get you boys to safety and that's... where's Ralph?
"One... more... time! HELLO MA BABY... HELLO MA HONEY... HELLO MY RAGTIME GAL. DOUBLETIME, NOW. SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE..."
"Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair."
"Ah, yes. Uh, take a good look at him, Nelson, cause that's where you're headed."
"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
"But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ooh, delightfully devilish, Seymour."
"May I interest you in a Jello brick, Sir? There's a grape in the center."
"Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry."
"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
"D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention."
"I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths."
"Lord, give me guidance. That's right, the guidance department -- detention room. Thank you, Mrs. Lord."
Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
"Now, ah, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I think the kids will follow it to Tuesday."
"The best photographs, or ""photos"", will be prominently displayed in the school lobby all year long."
"Well, if you took ""space case"" on a date... and brought me to chaperone along with her mother..."
"...annnd that concludes tonight's auction, which has raised a school record one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars!"
Now let's raise the roof for the bland informative rap of M. C. Safety and the Caution Crew!
"When Edna Met Seymour... ""Ghost Willie""... ""Killing Seymour's Mother""... ""The Principal Who Sold A Screenplay""..."
"If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world."
"Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that. Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield."
Hitting it off already! I haven't seen such a natural pair since half-sandwich and soup of the day.
"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
"Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat."
"Hmmm, I haven't seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon. Well, William, another school year gone by."
"""Two and Two are Four, Four and Four are Eight, Eight and Eight are Sixteen..."""
"""Please excuse my handwriting. I busted whichever hand it is I write with. Signed, Mrs. Simpson."" You were right to be suspicious, Edna. To the crime lab."
"I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice."
"Darn right, I'm the boss. Don't forget, I can send you back where you came from... college boy."
It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
"Young man, the school dress code specifically forbids the wearing of earrings... unless you're of gypsy extraction."
"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
"For your information, I am not a loser! I'm a successful principal who paints houses in the summertime."
"We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance."
"Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away."
"A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello?"
The students will do anything she says. She's captured their imagination like a bright piece of construction paper.
"Yes, well, while I disagree with your T-shirt's assertion, I do encourage anything that raises glacier awareness. Busward to adventure!"
"Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby."
"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
"Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes."
"I'm afraid that due to funding cuts, we've had to sell the Science Department skeleton and replace it with this Halloween costume."
"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
"Well, this was a big bust. Come on, kids. Let's go home to our mothers."
"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
Plus our last bake sale was a disaster. People took bites without buying the cookies.
"Edna Krabappel, will you marry me? Now I must warn you, two months' salary only bought me the ring box."
"We replaced the fanfare with classical music, and instead of chasing a rabbit the dogs chase a diploma."
"Therefore, space in the fallout shelter will be reserved for Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince, our championship kickball team, and Sherri, but not Terri."
"Children, I hope we all have a pleasant and orderly day here at ""Satan's Anvil."" No one knows why the early settlers called it that, and I suppose we never will."
"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
How come you always run out of tardy slips before you run out of permission slips?
"Sir, if we let these hill folk into our school, our test scores would drop so low, we'd lose all federal funding."
"Go back to bed, Mother! I've got it under control. Listen, you crumb-bums, if you think I'm impressed, I am not!"
"Marge, Homer, this is Brody and Madison McKenna. Bart has been sharing a desk with their daughter Nikki."
"You will take art, you will enjoy art, and you will make something in a kiln your mother can use."
"Please, calm down, everyone! You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity... to, uh, initiate a dialogue... that would, uh, create a teachable moment... uh, something something buzz word, I got nothing."
"Attention everyone. Please welcome our Valedictorian, Lisa Simpson. She will be attending Yale...I mean, Hot Dog on a Stick Management Camp."
"Aaaaaand freeze! Now, who in Springfield will eat the poisoned broth? Whoo, it could be anyone, even Mr. Burns."
"Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. Release the balloon."
"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
"Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals..."
"I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch ""yes."""
"Mr. Szyslak, what name did the defendant ask for when he called you at your bar?"
"Bart, you wouldn't happen to know what sort of candy your Aunt Patty likes, would you?"
"""...But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."""
"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
"... so, from now on anything caught in your zipper will be handled by the school nurse, and not me. And now... are you adequately prepared to rock?"
"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
"If we didn't get them back by five, we'd be charged for the extra day."
"No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death."
"Hmm. So mother was right -- it was my fault. Go ahead, water it down some more."
"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese Needle Snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards.
...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
"Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
"Uh, now children, if you have to answer nature's call during the night, use this bucket next to Bart's head."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
"I never tire of that. Uh, one other announcement, at the end of the month we'll be participating in the Vice-President's Assessment Test."
"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
"The 2nd Battle of Springfield was fought by the North...the South...and the East...to keep Springfield in, out of, and next to the Union, respectively. Now, the actual battle was fought over there, where that man is standing. But he won't move, so we'll do it here."
"I'm here to tell you about a field trip so amazing we've put ""sign here"" stickers on the permission slips."
"Illinois! Eighteen fifty-eight! Please welcome, here to debate the important issues of the day, Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln!"
"""Prisoner 24601""... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I'd see the old girl again."
You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
"Oh? Well, I've always admired your tart honesty and ability to be personally offended by broad social trends."
