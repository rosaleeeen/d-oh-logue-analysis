"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
"Yes, yes! That's it! Oh, I could go for one of those right now!"
But they're so wretchedly adorable! Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns. I can't do it!
"...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful."
"We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown..."
The game is afoot! I smell fear... mixed with curry!
"Your clownish behavior notwithstanding, we have made a gentleman's agreement and sworn on our lives to honor it."
"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."
"No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers."
A picture of me with a smiling child?! I can get my plant back!
"You're quite the friendly fellow, but right now I'm looking for a patsy."
"Young man, I look at you and I see myself."
Welcome to the American dream: a billionaire using public funds to construct a private playground for the rich and powerful.
Now there's nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the kudos to roll in.
"You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia."
"Oh, have you now? Well huzzah, huzzah. I'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight."
"Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now."
"You know, I've always had a keen eye for tiny talent."
What! Blast his hide to Hades! And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
"Why you young ragamuffin. I was never one to back away from a snowball fight. Smithers, you may fire at will."
"Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate."
"Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!"
Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph.
"Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant."
"Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die."
That intrepid lad is my great grandfather! Franklin Jefferson Burns. Tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the Fenway Flounder.
We have to turn this business around! Time to think outside the boxeola... what would Mark Cuban do?
"There you are, my good man. A little broth will cure your mental illness."
"Just give me your answer! And make it quick! Our current ""account man,"" Robert Marlowe here, is retiring at the end of the month."
"... Now, a few more details about this year's company picnic. It's at the plant, no food will be served, the only activity will be work, and the picnic is cancelled."
This is an outrage! Since when are public figures fair game for satire?
"It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers."
"Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all."
"Welcome, all! Now to explain why I summoned you here."
"Smithers, I'm a proud fellow, and it's not easy for me to admit defeat. But I know just the thing to make me feel better -- shopping!"
You mean there are actually people who will pay good money for garbage?
Smithers! Run down to Sears Roebuck and get a five-eighths inch Phillips head bolt!
"Then say yes to this raise, this promotion, and this flannel shirt which says ""I'm not screwing you over!"""
"Is that so? Well I have the feeling you'll be ""dropping"" the charges..."
"Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?"
"Yes... All right... Uh-huh... It's good to see you, too... Now then, in case you get bored, here's the playroom."
Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you.
"Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one!"
"Nor will we have the chance to marvel at number one draft pick Muk Mu, the human North Pole."
"No, I'm afraid he'll be on the first kayak back to Ketchikan."
60 watts! What do you think this is -- a tanning salon?
"Smithers, why haven't I heard of this ""The Leader?"" He's as rich and wicked as I, but he seems to enjoy tax exempt status."
"""All I lost was money?"" Let me make one thing perfectly clear -- our dalliance meant nothing to me! You were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak, and now I cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon! Consider this ill-conceived affair terminated!"
Not for one Chinese second! And I'm sure she's forgotten all about me.
"You... have a husband? Yes, I can picture him now... rugged good looks... sweater knotted about his shoulders... curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold..."
"I raise a million dollars... and to sweeten the pot, my assistant, Smithers."
": Yes... But not completely full, for you see... / ""SOME MEN HUNT FOR SPORT, /OTHERS HUNT FOR FOOD / THE ONLY THING I'M HUNTING FOR / IS AN OUTFIT THAT LOOKS GOOD..."""
"This entire plant is in his name -- so when they come to put C. M. Burns in jail, it's the canary that does the time."
"Indeed it is. ""Evergreen Terrace"" is built atop a massive shale deposit."
"Would you like to be the first to take a tour of the plant, Li'l Lisa?"
"Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat."
"Why that's a fabulous idea. Anything else you'd like? How about real lead in the radiation shields? Urinal cakes maybe? Smithers, throw this at him."
Hmm... Who's that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib.
Fun? Is that how it's pronounced? I've only seen it written.
"Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine."
"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
"There isn't a prison made that can hold me! Prisons are still made of mud and wattles, right?"
"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
"Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or ""funkier."""
Do they know how many eggs it laid in your brain?
"Attention: while you've been showering here, I sold all your clothes."
"Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless."
"...after we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served..."
"Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility."
Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show.
"Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask."
"So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November."
They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!
YOU MAKE ME FEEL AS YOUNG / AS THE BLOOD I GET FROM SHEEP.
"Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart."
"Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!"
"Yes, feel their hatred. It makes you strong, powerful... alive!"
"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of ""booger man,"" but I'm really not such a bad ""dude."" Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid."
"Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?"
It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
"I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship: these are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital or sitting in some phony baloney church. Or synagogue. Questions?"
The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson!
Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
"Oh, capital idea, partner. People, if we meet this week's quota, I'll take you to the most duck-filled pond you ever sat by."
"Ah, Bobo reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. Ah, yes. Wonder..."
"Well done, Monkey! That other panda gave some unexpected zazz to the festivities, eh?"
"But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
"And what book is that? The Ape Who Wanted A Big Bonus? Stop wasting my time, you corn-fed man-cow."
So that hellhole became my Heavenhole. I joined the prison choir...and the Prison Beatles Tribute Band.
"No, no, no. A person, you know who I mean."
"Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers?"
"Non-violence never solved anything! Fine, curtsy boy, I'll try it your way."
That's preposterous. Zutroy here is as American as apple pie.
Awww. That's the kind of family unity I like to see. Smithers...
"Ah, welcome back, Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang up job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in sector 7-G."
"Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to."
I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
"Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection."
"Premix?! I beg your forgiveness, lad. Smithers! Pour it down your pants."
