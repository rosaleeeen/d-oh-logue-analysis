"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
"Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress square and true."
I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
"Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
"What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
"Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?"
"Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment..."
"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."
"You two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, Christian but not Baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
"Come on, people! You're safe as Sunday with me. I wouldn't hurt a fly!"
Would you mind watching the kids? I'm kinda in a pickle here.
"Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
"I'm not Ned, I'm a friendly dog. Oh, I'm not a good liar. I did come here to check on the... where's Rod?"
"Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see..."
"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
"Why, I'll give you a jump, I'll rotate your tires, I'll even fold up that map for you. I know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
"It says ""Show me your tie."" It's cute. C'mon, let's go."
"Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It. Did you catch the thief?"
"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
"A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon."
"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
"I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
"You know Marge, Maude and I had a fight right before she died..."
"Rod? Hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
"You wanna hit me. Well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
"Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for."
"Well, it might be fun to be a landlord. Landfella -- there's only one Lord!"
"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
"That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time."
"Don't be nervous, Ned. You've practiced this so many times in the shower."
"Well, Ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
I'm meek... but I could probably stand to be meeker.
"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
"Eh, you boys can go with the Simpsons. I'm not going to church today."
"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
"Hey there, neighbor. You look as puffed up as a peacock in a..."
This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this--
"I'll be right back, boys. I'm going to go help that lady."
"Now coach, I've tried to be Christian and respectful, but I guess I'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. Legally, I still own this house."
"Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money..."
"Oh, I'm afraid my Maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now."
"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
"Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and--"
"Sure is! That's why after Homer accidentally killed Edna, I married Maude's ghost!"
Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
"Well, what the heck. Who's ready to build an amusement park?"
"Homer, that's really touching. But my boys and I are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
"Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
"Howdy, Homer. You here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
MY MOUSTACHE / IS BRISTLY / MY LETTERS / ARE EPISTLY / AND I DON'T WANNA / MISLEAD YOU / I LIKE TO HUG AND KISSLY--
"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's JosÃ© Flanders..."
"Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream."
That tears it. I'll show Homer. I'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
Hell! Damn! Backside! Nothing matters anymore! I'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
This is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. I better talk this over with the big man.
"I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
"Well, I did finish first in the Walk For The Cure... of homosexuality."
There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer.
Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
"Well, if you're talking about root beer, I plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
"...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
"Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
That's right. And I may not go to church tomorrow.
Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
"Now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. Oh! Man, that's good."
"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
"Ohhh, why, everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine. And let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', God bless 'em."
"Sorry, Homer. Now, do you mind if I pray at your bedside?"
"Okay, ""Smallville""... super dog licks himself. That definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
"Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
"Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend."
"There's nothing but filth on TV. But with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
I resisted these for thirty-five years! Why did I wear them today?
"How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
"And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?"
"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
"Well, with triple word score, that's ninety! Ha-ha, I guess my luck is starting to even out."
"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE..."
