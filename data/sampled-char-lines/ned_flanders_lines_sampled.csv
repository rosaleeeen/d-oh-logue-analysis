"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
"Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--"
"Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."
"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
"Yep, I'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
"Oh, indeedily-doodily. I've even been in ""Streetcar"" once before. I played Blanche DuBois! Hmmm huh. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
"Hey there, Mr. Burns! For our half hour I thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
"Oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
"How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""?"
"Well, actually, I picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
"You know, Homer's givin' it the old bible college try. Maybe I should have dialed down the Doubting Thomas."
"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
"I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in."
"Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor."
"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
"Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
"That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."
"Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong?"
"Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!
"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
"Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence."
He taught us how to live a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar.
"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
"Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!
"Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
"We'll just see about that-- Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake-- Nope. It's airtight."
"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
"Sixty Minutes -- Morley Safer has questionable pants fold -- ""The L Word"" -- used the ""L"" word."
"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
"I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
"That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal! Welcome to the club!"
"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
AND PURPLE AND WHITE AND PINK AND ORANGE / AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH...
"THEN I DOUBT YOU'LL LIKE NED FLANDERS / OR HIS CREEPY LITTLE OFFSPRING, ROD AND TODD..."
"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
