CON,"No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed."
PER,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
ECO,"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
COM,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
LEI,I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
REL,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
REL,"Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
ECO,"All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
REL,"You know, I don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. Anyhoo, so I don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."
FAM,"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
REL,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
PER,I'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
REL,Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
REL,"...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
FAM,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
FAM,This could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. Can you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
PER,"Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically."
REL,"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
LEI,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
REL,"Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye."
FAM,"How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
LEI,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
LEI,"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."
FAM,"Hey, Homer, I need to ask ya a favor. My baby sitter canceled and I got tickets to a Christian rock concert."
COM,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
REL,"Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!"
FAM,"oh, they're grounded. I found out Rod watched a commercial for ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and Todd took a full day to tell me."
FAM,"IF YOU THINK I'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH..."
FAM,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
FAM,"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
REL,"Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
FAM,"Well, my Roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
FAM,"All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!"
FAM,"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
COM,I wish we lived in a place more like the America of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us Republicans.
FAM,"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
CON,"Now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of Cain and Abel!"
WRK,"Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
REL,Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?
PER,"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
COM,"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
REL,"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
FAM,"Here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type."
REL,"And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?"
ECO,"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
LEI,"Oh, I-I guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal European wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of Miss Ashley Judd!"
REL,No one was ever a monkey! Everything is what it was and always will be! God put us here and that's that!
COM,"Excuse me, that's your salad fork!... That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only!... What's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""Happy Birthday?"""
WRK,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
COM,"Springfield. My home town. Pretty little place. Although, even the Garden of Eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
FAM,"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
REL,"I'm dying! And there's Heaven. But who's that? Confucius? And Milton Berle? Boy, have I been barkin' up the wrong tree."
FAM,Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. It's the best darn diddly way to start your first Flanders day!
ECO,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
FAM,"Well, Toddy, you know how I said our friends are like the Canaanites? Today I realized they're more like the Midianites."
REL,Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.
LEI,"Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
ECO,"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
CON,"I don't wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote ""CHURCHY JOE"" on my face."
LEI,Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
REL,"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
FAM,Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a casket.
REL,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
REL,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
FAM,"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
REL,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
FAM,"Mmm. Dinner was delicious, Edna, but I can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get Principal Skinner jealous."
CON,"Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip."
COM,"Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
FAM,"I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
REL,"""They're Controlling Our Minds With Flu Shots?!"" I knew it. Well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
COM,"Ohhh, why, everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine. And let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', God bless 'em."
PER,It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
LEI,Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble.
REL,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
CON,"I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now."
FAM,"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
CON,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
FAM,"Now I must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
LEI,"Well, I'll just reimburse you right n-- Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot like that movie, ""Paper Moon."""
REL,"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
PER,"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
COM,"You poor thing! I've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. Girls, welcome to your very own Ned and Breakfast."
FAM,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
REL,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
FAM,"Well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
COM,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
FAM,"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's JosÃ© Flanders..."
FAM,"Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
ECO,So I can rent it back to you. Just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
LEI,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
WRK,"Well, we pulled more plugs than a Dutch doctor. Now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
CON,"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
REL,"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
FAM,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
REL,"Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" Volumes One, Two and Four."
COM,"And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr..."
ECO,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
ECO,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
CON,"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
ECO,"Yeah, it's Ned Flanders. The teens have been chasing me all night. They finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
FAM,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
COM,"Marge, I hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but I just want to thank you for your early Christmas card."
FAM,"It's the ripcord from a Band-Aid wrapper! Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
FAM,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
COM,"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
PER,"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
PER,You know what? I'm not gonna. My mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
FAM,Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
LEI,"Well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that safety gear. Helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
COM,"Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
CON,"You wanna hit me. Well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
WRK,"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM / I'LL MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN / WHEN PLAYTIME IS A SAFE TIME, EVERYBODY WINS..."
FAM,"What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!"
FAM,"Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle. All diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
PER,"Oh, can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady Neddy."
COM,"Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
ECO,"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
PER,"When I was putting new insulation in your attic, I slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
CON,"Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
CON,"Patty and Selma?! Sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
COM,"Homer? Yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... I guess. So, what say we have lunch?"
WRK,"Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team."
REL,They're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. Even though there's nothing about it in the Bible!
REL,"The Bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread."
