WRK,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
CON,"But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed ""Charlie"" to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right..."
WRK,"Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away."
CON,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
WRK,"Children, the times, they are a-becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all time low. So I've come up with these ""Academic Alerts."" You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. This way, your parents won't have to wait until report card time to punish you."
PER,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
WRK,"As you recall these stickers came from last year's field trip to the ""sign here"" sticker factory. But thanks to my old navy buddy -- we both love to shop at Old Navy...the students of this school will be taking a ride on a nuclear-powered, attack-class submarine -- the U.S.S. Tom Clancy!"
WRK,"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
WRK,"You may find his accent peculiar. Certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I urge you all to give little Adil the benefit of the doubt. In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world."
WRK,"Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead."
COM,"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
WRK,"Good morning class. A certain agitator -- for privacy's sake let's call her Lisa S. -- No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson -- has raised questions about certain school policies. So in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film."
PER,"Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that ""someone"" had slashed the pillow."
WRK,"Attention students. It's time once again to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's all prove how adult we can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner. Even though it's first-come first-serve, and the most popular sports fill up fast."
CON,"The year was 1968. We were on re-con in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan, ""UP WITH MINI-SKIRTS."" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it."
WRK,"The 2nd Battle of Springfield was fought by the North...the South...and the East...to keep Springfield in, out of, and next to the Union, respectively. Now, the actual battle was fought over there, where that man is standing. But he won't move, so we'll do it here."
COM,"The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of ""independence"" to cover their search for the gem."
WRK,"Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that."
PER,"But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teacher's lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy."
WRK,"I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed."
CON,"""Dear Bart, your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten. However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. Seymour Skinner."""
CON,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
PER,"Mmm-hmm, it's Mr. Skinner now. I'm just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I don't know what we'll do without you. Well, so long."
WRK,"Time for a head count. Children, line up according to height... no, weight... no, the sum total of the letters in your last names if each letter is assigned a numeric value according to its place in the alphabet! Quickly now!"
LEI,"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
LEI,"Well, this party is certainly a break in my routine. You know, normally I spend my Saturdays carefully laying out my clothes for the following week, and then I stroll down to the car wash to see if Gus is there..."
WRK,I'm delighted to report that your grade brought the entire school's GPA up to our state's minimum standard. We now qualify for a Basic Assistance Grant. It's the greatest honor the school has ever received! And it's all thanks to you.
WRK,"People let's have good assembly manners. People, people. Quiet down, now, please. Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents and music lovers. Welcome to the first in a series of Saturday evening concerts."
CON,"That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake."
WRK,"By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to..."
ECO,"Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well."
WRK,"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
LEI,"I'm afraid there are some problems with my tickets. I asked for a center seat, not an aisle seat. I specifically requested not to have the kosher meal. And I booked the flight leaving Saturday morning, not Friday morning!"
PER,"Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here in the mean streets of ""N'Awlins."" Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield, but in my heart I... I've always been a small-time hustler."
WRK,"Attention. This is Principal Skinner, your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. Dammit I wish we hadn't let the students name that one."
WRK,"I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of ""Rubber v. Glue"" and reaffirmed by ""I Know You Are v. What Am I."""
WRK,Let me explain this to you in terms even the simplest will understand. We're hiding you in Capital City for the day so your numb-skullery won't drag down the test scores of the children who are our future.
WRK,"Are you mad, Brunella? You can't fail Lisa. She's the only child keeping this school accredited. Without her, we'd have to release these children back into the forest. So let's just turn that minus into a plus..."
WRK,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
FAM,"Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I don't want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight."
LEI,"""...and so, Lucinda placed the fifth shard in the stained-glass window, which now clearly read: 'your parents are alive.' Gregor turned to his twin sister and they both understood: their journey was just beginning. The end."""
PER,"Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred."
FAM,"Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed."
WRK,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."
WRK,"I hope you all enjoy your ride to and tour of the Springfield Shopper Newspaper. Groundskeeper Willie and I will stay behind to remove all traces of asbestos and the word ""evolution"" from our school."
FAM,"Now, Simpson. I-I had a discomforting thought on the way over here. This dinner wouldn't be a master plan of yours to set me up with some unmarried relation? Because I can assure you that..."
PER,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."
PER,"""...But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."""
WRK,"Please, calm down, everyone! You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity... to, uh, initiate a dialogue... that would, uh, create a teachable moment... uh, something something buzz word, I got nothing."
ECO,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
PER,"I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say."
PER,"I'm sorry, everyone. I perpetrated this charade. The boy can read, and Edna Krabappel is the greatest teacher I have ever known. If she can teach me to love, then she can teach anything."
WRK,"Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph."
FAM,"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
PER,"It appears to be some sort of rock. I-- Oh, no, it's just a clump of dirt. Even so, my heart is pounding like a kettle drum. I'd better sit down for a moment."
CON,"I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school!"
WRK,"Students may spend up to ten points per day in up to four of seven categories. Unused points roll over week to week, but not month to month. Categories not included: meat, dairy, vegetables..."
FAM,"Oh, yes. I've heard they can be difficult. Patty, the Parents Advisory Board has asked that I attend the premiere of Space Mutants Part 5 tomorrow night. Would you be interested in joining me?"
ECO,"Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores."
WRK,"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
WRK,"Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning."
PER,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
WRK,"Mm-hm. It's a vicious ovoraptor. It feasts on bird eggs, and lays its own eggs in the nest. The unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch and devour her, too."
WRK,"All our other attempts to get a spy inside the Bart Simpson operation have failed. Uter, Ralph, Doug the hip guidance counselor... he's never been the same since Bart got through with him."
FAM,"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
WRK,"I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of internet chatter. I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive."
ECO,"What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels."
WRK,"Oh, you think this stolen 'H' is a laugh riot, don't you? Well, I'll tell you something that's not so funny: right now, Superintendent Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl!"
WRK,"Seriously? Why? With Nelson gone, lunch money's finally making its way to the cafeteria. Nurples are returning to their natural, non-purple hue. Besides, I hear he's doing quite well with his bicycle pimpery."
WRK,"And now in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when I typed in ""G.M.O."" plus ""danger"" plus ""question mark""."
FAM,"Mother's gone too far. She's put cardboard over her half of the television. We rented ""Man Without a Face"" -- I didn't even know he had a problem. What should I do?"
FAM,"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
FAM,"You know, I always thought I'd fall for a woman just like Mother... even though I didn't want to. And now that I haven't, I've discovered what true happiness can be, Edna."
FAM,"Yes, about that. Mother's neck wattle got caught in a zipper. I've got a long night of boo-boo kissing ahead of me but don't worry, I got you these store-bought apples instead."
WRK,"You listen to me, son. You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say?"
WRK,"Yes, the school nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his little face after the fight. Goodbye, son. I guess you were right. All that homework was a waste of your time."
FAM,"Door to door sugar? What a marvelous idea! What's that, mother? I'm just talking to the sugar man. Mother, I'm a big boy. I can do as I wish. Excuse me."
WRK,"Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, I'll double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game."
WRK,"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
WRK,"Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there."
WRK,"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
WRK,"The school is looking for a new ""Safety Salamander"". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender."
WRK,"Children, I hope we all have a pleasant and orderly day here at ""Satan's Anvil."" No one knows why the early settlers called it that, and I suppose we never will."
WRK,"Welcome to another school year. One important note: the flower-based names of the reading groups are now barnyard-based. Mr. Becker has protested the move, so his group will remain the Daffodils."
WRK,"These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey."
CON,"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
WRK,"Welcome seniors and sexually precocious underclassmen. I'd like to say goodbye to those who are going off to college, or to fight in Gulf War Five: ""Operation Find Our President's Head."""
PER,"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
WRK,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
FAM,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."
WRK,"Why is it that women ""appear"" to be worse at math then men? What is the source of this ""illusion?"" Or, as I call it, ""the biggest lie ever told."""
WRK,"It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, ""tough hate"", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away."
ECO,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
COM,"While I'm on a roll I'm gonna call that carpet cleaning service and tell them our hallway doesn't count as a room! Hello, is AndrÃ© there? Oh yes, I'll hold!"
WRK,"I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill."
WRK,"This is a proud day. Now, when people ask if we're in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, ""We are closer than ever before!"""
WRK,"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
WRK,"Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate."
WRK,"Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
WRK,"And Lisa, you have a choice. You may continue to be challenged in third grade, or return to second grade and be merely a big fish in a small pond--"
WRK,I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
WRK,"Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation..."
WRK,"I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY EVIL PLAN / SAY GOODBYE TO MUSIC, GYM AND ART / SOON WE WILL HAVE THE PERFECT SCHOOL / WHERE FUN AND EXCITEMENT NEVER START!"
WRK,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
WRK,"This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."""
WRK,"First rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more impressive than Martin's milk carton ukulele. Willie, you can throw out the other projects, we have a winner!"
WRK,"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."
WRK,"Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular ""Popularity Awards"" -- the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers! No way that can go wrong! First up, Campus Clown..."
WRK,"It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work."
REL,"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
PER,"You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of."
CON,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
WRK,"Yes. Anyway, as a reward for your studying, I've decided to welcome you back to our school. You'll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, Dol... Oh dear God!"
WRK,"Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their appendixes removed. So without further ado, I give you the remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra."
WRK,"Well done, the band. We're all bursting with pride after our girls' basketball team beat Shelbyville two-nothing in triple overtime! Now let's make some noise!!! Using our INSIDE VOICES!"
WRK,"Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such as yourself will go hungry. Now please welcome the star of ""Stuffwich's"" ads, who lost four hundred pounds eating only ""Stuffwich"" subs -- Ezra."
FAM,"Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner."
WRK,"Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker -- I know he can teach us a lot about business -- Mr. C. Montgomery Burns!"
WRK,"Well, I'm uh, I'm afraid Edna has gone from tardy to absent. So uh, let's uh move onto the reception and forget this awkwardness with some delicious shrimp mocktail."
WRK,"What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege."
FAM,"""Ebony and Ivory""? I'm afraid that song's taken! By me and my mother. You know, people say when we're on stage, it's more like ""Scary-oke."" Scary talented, I assume."
COM,"Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day?"
WRK,"Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter."
FAM,"Oh, but you love silhouette night! And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions and -- Mother, why are you all dressed up?"
WRK,"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
COM,"And you should be. The city's Multicultural Council has invited one lucky student to perform at City Hall. Lisa, you'll be representing us, and the noble Hitachee people!"
WRK,"Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one's for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire.."
WRK,"Yes, yes. Very good wrath. Ah, let's see, our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Eh... But this is just an empty box!"
WRK,"... so, from now on anything caught in your zipper will be handled by the school nurse, and not me. And now... are you adequately prepared to rock?"
WRK,"Well, I'm going to take advantage of this rare opportunity, even if you children aren't interested. Uh... Which do you think is more important: hard work or stick-to-it-iveness?"
WRK,I'd like you to give this note to Edna when you get back to class. I don't think I have to tell you it's for her eyes only.
WRK,"Happy three in the morning, everyone! In a mere five hours, we'll be gazing at Springfield's most exciting glacier, Springfield Glacier. I hope you're all wearing glacier-appropriate clothing."
CON,"Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done. I accept that I killed my mother. My whole life she's belittled me! Maybe deep down... I'm glad."
FAM,"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
WRK,"Students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield Time Capsule...where your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first century...and..."
WRK,"First, you're going to give back everything you've stolen, then I'm sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work known to man: janitorial work."
WRK,"I've just received some rather unusual news regarding your unprecedented A-triple-plus. To be honest, I'm surprised and saddened. No, not saddened, what's the word...? Ah yes, delighted."
LEI,"Nice job, Simpson. You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player. She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band."
LEI,"Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson -- and no Milhouse, for that matter. Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds."
WRK,"Now peasants, since the middle ages had no compact discs or Super Mario Men, people found entertainment in abusing the village idiot. So, let history come alive!"
WRK,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
PER,MS. KRABAPPEL / A SAD PRINCIPAL / IS DESPERATE AND NEEDY / IF YOU COME HOME / I WON'T DIE ALONE / AND THAT'S WHAT I'D PREFER...
FAM,"Oh, there's mother now. Watching me. What's that, mother? They have a right to be here. It's school business. I... Mother, that sailor suit doesn't fit anymore!"
WRK,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""
WRK,"Mrs. Krabappel had to go to Portland. Apparently, the people she hired to de-program her sister from that cult turned out to be an even worse cult."
WRK,"Powerful work. And now he's going to make a documentary about Springfield Elementary, which I assume will be glowing and positive, unlike all of his other work."
WRK,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to announce the winner of the science fair. Though I must note I'm surprised Lisa Simpson didn't enter a project this year!"
LEI,Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
CON,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation."
WRK,"It is with great joy and a sense of once again everything is back to where it started, that we welcome our once and future Groundskeeper... Willie!"
WRK,"""Please excuse my handwriting. I busted whichever hand it is I write with. Signed, Mrs. Simpson."" You were right to be suspicious, Edna. To the crime lab."
WRK,"Some student -- possibly Bart Simpson -- has been circulating candy hearts featuring crude, off-color sentiments. Well let me tell you something, Valentine's Day is no joke..."
WRK,"Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we've ever had. I really do. And now, here's Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices."
WRK,"Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,"
WRK,"Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display!"
WRK,"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
WRK,"Lisa, your outburst was either a sign of deep emotional imbalance, or a passionate response to a sobering truth. Luckily, the treatment for both is intensive therapy."
WRK,"This globe will never spin again. Now, class, I want you to be creative with your video projects. I don't want to see thirty ""Blair Witch"" knock-offs."
WRK,"And it's all thanks to Donny here, who can happily live the rest of his life knowing he betrayed the one boy who actually cared about him."
WRK,"Attention, students. In order to cut down on the rash of embarrassing YouTube videos of our teachers, we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones."
WRK,"Yes, of course -- I think we can wrangle you a used bicycle. Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy? Bart? Where did he-- My car keys!"
FAM,"We can't continue on like this, trying to build a private relationship in public -- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb."
WRK,"Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation. There's no mystery about Willie. Why, he simply disappeared... Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up."
WRK,"Pranks, inside use of outside voice, off-color whistling, and you're stricken from the list. And once crossed off, you stay crossed off. That's what pens do."
WRK,"I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying ""I don't care. My kid's a loser."""
PER,"Am I wearing women's clothes? I didn't notice. When I look in my closet, I don't see male clothes or female clothes. They're all the same."
WRK,"All right. Pick your size, extra-small or extra-large. We've got both. No pushing now... I... What?... Oh. I've just been informed we've run out of extra-large."
WRK,"Ahhh, these uniforms are a godsend. Horseplay is down 40 percent. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half, and high spirits are at an all-time low."
ECO,"G.M. Chrysler!! I can't afford that! But I can't close the school a day early just to suit my vacation. Or can I? Think, Seymour, think..."
WRK,"Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere."
WRK,"No, all I meant was, from what I've seen, boys are better at math, science... the real subjects. There, that should put the matter behind us."
WRK,"Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!"
PER,"Now Willie, don't tell anyone I'm trying my stand-up comedy act tonight. If the students find out I'm performing at Floppy's, I'll never live it down."
CON,"Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School."
ECO,"A contest? But, sir, we don't have any money to pay for prizes. We had to rent out our multi-purpose room to a Japanese-American social club."
WRK,"Meet your new teacher, Ms. Cantwell. Do not call her by the obvious dirty nickname. Now I must meet with the new art teacher Mr. Testaclese."
WRK,"You know, when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a school mural, I almost thought he said a school Muriel. Muriel's his sister. And uh... Thank you, Bruce Vilanch."
WRK,"It's already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the NeNe. And it has nasty plans for the booby, the titmouse, the woodcock, and the titpecker."
WRK,Please don't air this. I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance -- you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k-ball.
WRK,"No, of course you didn't. The establishment I work for delivers pizzas to everyone, and then gives the customer the option of accepting or refusing delivery."
ECO,"Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry."
COM,"Lisa, Lisa... go home, relax, try to do some kid things. You know, with a ball or something... or decorate your sneakers with a ""Magic""-brand marker."
WRK,"And now, because the children are our future, here are the children of Springfield Elementary with a song they call ""The Children are our Future."" Children?"
CON,"Bart, eyewitnesses to your fight described you as ""berserkoid,"" ""totally aggro,"" and said you punched Milhouse ""like fifty billion times."" That's an excessive number of times."
ECO,"Now, now, leave the money out of this. It's not the money's fault you cheated. Besides, I've already started spending it. Check out the new scoreboard!"
WRK,"Now, uh, people, there's been some confusion about our bird-sighting rules. You cannot count birds that you've seen at the zoo, on stamps, or in dreams."
PER,"Unfortunately, the studios have made it clear they're not interested in my work. In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome on the Universal Studios tour."
WRK,"Well illustrated, Nelson. And now, fasten your funnybones for Groundskeeper -- oh, or should I say Grinskeeper... No, I'm sorry, Groundskeeper was correct -- Willie!"
LEI,"Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby."
WRK,"Uh, ladies and gentlemen. I must apologize. This man does not speak for the council of Alphas. We hold you sub-Omeguloids in the highest regard."
WRK,"I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths."
WRK,"Attention all students. Please report to an attorney-mandated school assembly. To make time for this, the third grade's performance of ""My Fair Lady"" is cancelled."
LEI,"But we'll have the last laugh on those Johnny-Come-Not-lies. We're gonna watch my favorite movie, about a Grinchy little character who tries to ""steal"" Christmas."
WRK,"Not you. Never you. And due to budget cuts, until Edna comes back, I have no choice but to merge the school's two fourth-grade classes."
WRK,"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
WRK,"Well, if this episode has taught us anything, it's that nothing works better than the status quo. Bart, you're promoted back to the fourth grade."
WRK,"Hmm, not a cloud in the sky -- a perfect day to unveil Operation SLAAAM: So Long Athletics Art And Music. Care for a T-shirt?"
LEI,"Well, I guess as long as I fold it afterward and don't display it at night... Oh, perhaps I should improvise, or ""do an improv?"""
FAM,"It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. I know he likes the sleeveless look..."
COM,"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
LEI,"Now normally I wouldn't go near a giant chocolate cake in my dress polyester, but with Bart Simpson safely encapsulated, I'd be delighted to pose."
ECO,"In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music..."
COM,"Why, there are no children here at the Four 'H' Club either! Am I so out of touch? No. It's the children who are wrong."
CON,"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
WRK,"Yes, Go to Work with Your Parents Day! Tomorrow, you will learn by doing and apply your knowledge of fractions and gym to real-world situations!"
CON,"Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man. Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners."
WRK,"But just in case you want to do any more thinking, I'm proud to present you with an official key to the study hall."
WRK,"No, no, no. It's the differences -- of which there are none -- that make the sameness... exceptional. Just tell me what to say!"
ECO,"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
WRK,"Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back."
WRK,"Bart, I'm flabbergasted. Surely you knew, as you were writing your own name in forty-foot-high letters in the field, that you would be caught."
WRK,It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
WRK,"Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don't think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize!"
WRK,It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen! Now to find out who did this.
FAM,"So, Edna, I uh, I wrote up some possible discussion topics for this trip. Oh, here's one: I'm still in love with you. Discuss?"
WRK,"Gentlemen, according to my sources you are planning to simultaneously drop your pencils at 2:15 this afternoon. Do so and you will be suspended."
WRK,I'll handle this. Simpson! I'm giving you 'til the count of three to come out. One... two... three. I've done all I can do.
WRK,"Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it. I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired."
FAM,"Mother, how did you get this number -- it's a prop phone! Yes, I have your celery... I took the limpest stalk there was!"
PER,Careful with those peanut crumbs! My allergy is so sensitive a single molecule would make my throat close like a museum at four forty-five.
WRK,"All right, Bart, I didn't want to resort to this, but... this drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary late last week."
WRK,"We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy."
FAM,"We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room."
ECO,"Lisa, without corporate sponsorship, we wouldn't be able to teach you the three R's: reading, refreshment and Raspberry Buzz Lite. Get your razz on!"
CON,"No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this: they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible."
WRK,"Oh the list of things you don't know could fill a week's worth of morning announcements, with enough left over for a send-home flyer!"
ECO,"Thank you. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, we are canceling art, music, and dance. Please evacuate the auditorium before it's bulldozed into a mini-mall."
WRK,"Uh, well, as a matter of fact, my refrigerator wasn't running. You spared me quite a bit of spoilage. Thank you, anonymous young man."
WRK,"Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study. This assembly will remedy that."
WRK,"Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting."
WRK,"Now today we have a special guest: a documentary filmmaker whose works include ""Lost Luggage, Shattered Lives,"" and ""Upskirt Dreams."" Please welcome Declan Desmond."
LEI,"Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half."
FAM,I'M A COOTIE EATER / I'VE BEEN ONE ALL MY LIFE. / I LIKE THE COOTIES SO MUCH / I HAVE A COOTIE WIFE.
WRK,"To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated, I have decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms."
FAM,I'll be right there! Just saying goodbye to mother! Seymour! I'm going out for a walk! See you in several months at the soonest!
WRK,"I search all the children's Facebook pages for unflattering references to me. By the way, I enjoyed the photos of your trip to Yosemite."
FAM,"Mother doesn't approve of me dating, so I need you to keep her busy for a few hours while Edna and I sneak out."
FAM,"Family, eh? That's right, your brother is Bart Simpson, one of Mrs. Krabappel's fourth graders. And your father is a local character of note."
LEI,"Astonishing news out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin: the Olympic Committee has announced that Mixed Curling will be a Demonstration Event at the Winter Olympics!"
LEI,"Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that. Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield."
PER,"When I was starting out, they said ""You're good -- but are you 'plaque' good?"" Well, today I can say ""Yes I am!"""
ECO,I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and his slant- drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.
CON,"Therefore, space in the fallout shelter will be reserved for Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince, our championship kickball team, and Sherri, but not Terri."
FAM,"No, mother, I did not use any of your talc. I don't know why the bottle feels lighter. Maybe you're just getting stronger!"
WRK,"Good morning, students. Way to go there, Wendell. There's Ralph -- he knows the score. Jimbo, how's that hat today? Janey, Janey, bo-faney!"
FAM,I understand. It can be very difficult for a woman to propose marriage. But I am willing to go halvsies on a ring.
WRK,"I was going to tell you this privately, but... because of your incredibly low test score, we're sending you back to third grade."
WRK,"Skate! Skate! As fast as you can. / But I'll catch you, I'm the Principal Man! That's the kind of education you're missing."
ECO,"This orange drink is the only way to recoup our terrible losses from ""Fire Drill Follies."" I just don't know what went wrong."
CON,"I knew egging my house was just a ploy. You see, the rat who told you about my rat was also a rat."
WRK,"I never tire of that. Uh, one other announcement, at the end of the month we'll be participating in the Vice-President's Assessment Test."
WRK,"The V.P.A.T. is part of the Federal Government's ""No Child Left Alone Act."" It'll be a rewarding day of pencil sharpening and eyes-on-your-own-paper-keeping..."
LEI,"Yes, quite so. As you can see, I'm holding a big number two in my hands, enjoying the weight and feel of it."
CON,"Children, remain calm... find your disaster buddy... which is different from your lab partner, but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy."
COM,"It's a comic strip I do called ""Bumble and Grumble."" Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son."
WRK,"Hmm... Well there's still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don't you tell your teacher I let you go home early."
WRK,"Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service."
COM,"Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school pep squad could've cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven!"
CON,"Bart, because of your sister's restraining order, there is no place in this school you can legally occupy, without violating your order. Observe."
PER,"I... No, wait! We're not going anywhere. I'm going to do what Bart should have told me to do a long time ago!"
WRK,"Yes, it's like you're Harry Potter without the magic and wonder. Just sign these authorization forms and you can be on your way."
ECO,"In order to save money, the following presidents will no longer be taught: Buchanan, Fillmore, Pierce, Bush, Bush... could you please stop that?"
CON,"""Prisoner 24601""... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I'd see the old girl again."
WRK,"Okay, delegates. You leave tomorrow for the statewide model U.N., so this is our last chance to bone up. And bone we will."
WRK,"Lisa Simpson, you have just been transferred to the Springfield magnet school for the gifted and troublesome. Please climb into the idling bus."
ECO,"Lisa, please. Help me lure them back. I had to do what I did. Our budget is stretched tighter than mother's sauna pants."
WRK,"Well thank you, Bart. I only hope that for the next few hours you and I can leave our differences in the schoolyard."
WRK,"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
ECO,"Moving on, our class trip to Italy is now spaghetti night at Papa John's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded."
PER,What if Bart took music lessons? Music lessons could channel his destructive impulses into artistic expression. I myself have been taking flamenco lessons.
WRK,"Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals..."
CON,"I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes... I believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating your shorts."
WRK,"You know, a principal's dream would be to have a school with nothing but Lisa Simpsons. Unfortunately, the rest of you exist."
WRK,"Yes, I know what that means -- I've learned so much today! This is my school and I'm throwing out the test!"
PER,Today I received an education in how children really learn: by seeing their principal run around on top of a shipping container.
WRK,"Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn."
ECO,"I'm afraid that due to funding cuts, we've had to sell the Science Department skeleton and replace it with this Halloween costume."
COM,"Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed. Don't hide your light in a smoky back room, making dusty old decisions."
COM,"What about the media? They're not covering the issues, they just want to declare a frontrunner and go back to their mansions."
WRK,"Okay Lisa... ...to study in Rome, an applicant needs outstanding grades, check... Uh-oh. Lisa, it says you have to speak fluent Italian."
WRK,"Heh-heh-heh, watch out Beatles! Now I have one more important announcement to share with you. Would Lisa Simpson join me on stage?"
PER,I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE / NOT LITERALLY / IT MEANS THAT I'M HAPPY / POST-COITALLY / IT WAS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT!
CON,"Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit."
WRK,"As Principal, I'd just like to say a few words about what this wonderful woman means to this school and to me."
PER,"Well, since Edna dumped me, I've been wandering around this park all night. It's educational and offers mild thrills. Just like Edna."
WRK,"Sir, if we let these hill folk into our school, our test scores would drop so low, we'd lose all federal funding."
WRK,"Before we begin, children, may I remind you the school computers are not to be used to access PrincipalSkinnerStinks.com, Skinnersucks.org or Shavedskinner.edu."
ECO,"We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance."
WRK,"I guess it is a little funny... Nonetheless, I will find the culprit. We'll start with, oh, I don't know... Bart Simpson!"
WRK,"Attention. This is an emergency broadcast. All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total -- Hey, gimme that."
COM,"Young man, I can assure you my posterior is nothing more than flesh, bone, and that metal plate I got in 'Nam."
WRK,"Uh-oh. Two independent thought alarms in one day. The students are over stimulated. Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms."
WRK,"Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out. So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin."
WRK,"Order, order! Do you kids want to be like the real U.N., or do you just want to squabble and waste time?"
WRK,"Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup, you read my mind. Just, uh, give me twenty minutes, or so, to finish these tardy slips."
WRK,Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. We've got to get you more time to study. But how?
COM,"...Miss Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments and unguents...and Jimbo, the school bully who will administer noogies and nipple twisters."
WRK,"Children, Groundskeeper Willie will direct you to your new school district. Any correlation to your talents, needs or friends is completely coincidental."
WRK,And now the results. First Grade Rep: results delayed indefinitely due to jelly on the ballots. Second Grade Rep: Isabel GutiÃ©rrez.
WRK,"But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock 'n bull story. They're out for cleaning, or whatever."
