Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed ""Charlie"" to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right..."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Children, the times, they are a-becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all time low. So I've come up with these ""Academic Alerts."" You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. This way, your parents won't have to wait until report card time to punish you."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"As you recall these stickers came from last year's field trip to the ""sign here"" sticker factory. But thanks to my old navy buddy -- we both love to shop at Old Navy...the students of this school will be taking a ride on a nuclear-powered, attack-class submarine -- the U.S.S. Tom Clancy!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"You may find his accent peculiar. Certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I urge you all to give little Adil the benefit of the doubt. In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Good morning class. A certain agitator -- for privacy's sake let's call her Lisa S. -- No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson -- has raised questions about certain school policies. So in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that ""someone"" had slashed the pillow."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Attention students. It's time once again to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's all prove how adult we can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner. Even though it's first-come first-serve, and the most popular sports fill up fast."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"The year was 1968. We were on re-con in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan, ""UP WITH MINI-SKIRTS."" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"The 2nd Battle of Springfield was fought by the North...the South...and the East...to keep Springfield in, out of, and next to the Union, respectively. Now, the actual battle was fought over there, where that man is standing. But he won't move, so we'll do it here."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of ""independence"" to cover their search for the gem."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teacher's lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"""Dear Bart, your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten. However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. Seymour Skinner."""
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"Mmm-hmm, it's Mr. Skinner now. I'm just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I don't know what we'll do without you. Well, so long."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Time for a head count. Children, line up according to height... no, weight... no, the sum total of the letters in your last names if each letter is assigned a numeric value according to its place in the alphabet! Quickly now!"
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Well, this party is certainly a break in my routine. You know, normally I spend my Saturdays carefully laying out my clothes for the following week, and then I stroll down to the car wash to see if Gus is there..."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,I'm delighted to report that your grade brought the entire school's GPA up to our state's minimum standard. We now qualify for a Basic Assistance Grant. It's the greatest honor the school has ever received! And it's all thanks to you.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"People let's have good assembly manners. People, people. Quiet down, now, please. Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents and music lovers. Welcome to the first in a series of Saturday evening concerts."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to..."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"I'm afraid there are some problems with my tickets. I asked for a center seat, not an aisle seat. I specifically requested not to have the kosher meal. And I booked the flight leaving Saturday morning, not Friday morning!"
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here in the mean streets of ""N'Awlins."" Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield, but in my heart I... I've always been a small-time hustler."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Attention. This is Principal Skinner, your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. Dammit I wish we hadn't let the students name that one."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of ""Rubber v. Glue"" and reaffirmed by ""I Know You Are v. What Am I."""
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,Let me explain this to you in terms even the simplest will understand. We're hiding you in Capital City for the day so your numb-skullery won't drag down the test scores of the children who are our future.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Are you mad, Brunella? You can't fail Lisa. She's the only child keeping this school accredited. Without her, we'd have to release these children back into the forest. So let's just turn that minus into a plus..."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I don't want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"""...and so, Lucinda placed the fifth shard in the stained-glass window, which now clearly read: 'your parents are alive.' Gregor turned to his twin sister and they both understood: their journey was just beginning. The end."""
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"I hope you all enjoy your ride to and tour of the Springfield Shopper Newspaper. Groundskeeper Willie and I will stay behind to remove all traces of asbestos and the word ""evolution"" from our school."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Now, Simpson. I-I had a discomforting thought on the way over here. This dinner wouldn't be a master plan of yours to set me up with some unmarried relation? Because I can assure you that..."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"""...But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."""
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Please, calm down, everyone! You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity... to, uh, initiate a dialogue... that would, uh, create a teachable moment... uh, something something buzz word, I got nothing."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"I'm sorry, everyone. I perpetrated this charade. The boy can read, and Edna Krabappel is the greatest teacher I have ever known. If she can teach me to love, then she can teach anything."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"It appears to be some sort of rock. I-- Oh, no, it's just a clump of dirt. Even so, my heart is pounding like a kettle drum. I'd better sit down for a moment."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Students may spend up to ten points per day in up to four of seven categories. Unused points roll over week to week, but not month to month. Categories not included: meat, dairy, vegetables..."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Oh, yes. I've heard they can be difficult. Patty, the Parents Advisory Board has asked that I attend the premiere of Space Mutants Part 5 tomorrow night. Would you be interested in joining me?"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Mm-hm. It's a vicious ovoraptor. It feasts on bird eggs, and lays its own eggs in the nest. The unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch and devour her, too."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"All our other attempts to get a spy inside the Bart Simpson operation have failed. Uter, Ralph, Doug the hip guidance counselor... he's never been the same since Bart got through with him."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of internet chatter. I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Oh, you think this stolen 'H' is a laugh riot, don't you? Well, I'll tell you something that's not so funny: right now, Superintendent Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl!"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Seriously? Why? With Nelson gone, lunch money's finally making its way to the cafeteria. Nurples are returning to their natural, non-purple hue. Besides, I hear he's doing quite well with his bicycle pimpery."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"And now in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when I typed in ""G.M.O."" plus ""danger"" plus ""question mark""."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Mother's gone too far. She's put cardboard over her half of the television. We rented ""Man Without a Face"" -- I didn't even know he had a problem. What should I do?"
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"You know, I always thought I'd fall for a woman just like Mother... even though I didn't want to. And now that I haven't, I've discovered what true happiness can be, Edna."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Yes, about that. Mother's neck wattle got caught in a zipper. I've got a long night of boo-boo kissing ahead of me but don't worry, I got you these store-bought apples instead."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"You listen to me, son. You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say?"
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Yes, the school nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his little face after the fight. Goodbye, son. I guess you were right. All that homework was a waste of your time."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Door to door sugar? What a marvelous idea! What's that, mother? I'm just talking to the sugar man. Mother, I'm a big boy. I can do as I wish. Excuse me."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, I'll double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"The school is looking for a new ""Safety Salamander"". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Children, I hope we all have a pleasant and orderly day here at ""Satan's Anvil."" No one knows why the early settlers called it that, and I suppose we never will."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Welcome to another school year. One important note: the flower-based names of the reading groups are now barnyard-based. Mr. Becker has protested the move, so his group will remain the Daffodils."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Welcome seniors and sexually precocious underclassmen. I'd like to say goodbye to those who are going off to college, or to fight in Gulf War Five: ""Operation Find Our President's Head."""
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"Why is it that women ""appear"" to be worse at math then men? What is the source of this ""illusion?"" Or, as I call it, ""the biggest lie ever told."""
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, ""tough hate"", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority, Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"While I'm on a roll I'm gonna call that carpet cleaning service and tell them our hallway doesn't count as a room! Hello, is AndrÃ© there? Oh yes, I'll hold!"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"This is a proud day. Now, when people ask if we're in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, ""We are closer than ever before!"""
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values, "Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"And Lisa, you have a choice. You may continue to be challenged in third grade, or return to second grade and be merely a big fish in a small pond--"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation..."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY EVIL PLAN / SAY GOODBYE TO MUSIC, GYM AND ART / SOON WE WILL HAVE THE PERFECT SCHOOL / WHERE FUN AND EXCITEMENT NEVER START!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."""
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"First rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more impressive than Martin's milk carton ukulele. Willie, you can throw out the other projects, we have a winner!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular ""Popularity Awards"" -- the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers! No way that can go wrong! First up, Campus Clown..."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Yes. Anyway, as a reward for your studying, I've decided to welcome you back to our school. You'll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, Dol... Oh dear God!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their appendixes removed. So without further ado, I give you the remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Well done, the band. We're all bursting with pride after our girls' basketball team beat Shelbyville two-nothing in triple overtime! Now let's make some noise!!! Using our INSIDE VOICES!"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such as yourself will go hungry. Now please welcome the star of ""Stuffwich's"" ads, who lost four hundred pounds eating only ""Stuffwich"" subs -- Ezra."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker -- I know he can teach us a lot about business -- Mr. C. Montgomery Burns!"
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"Well, I'm uh, I'm afraid Edna has gone from tardy to absent. So uh, let's uh move onto the reception and forget this awkwardness with some delicious shrimp mocktail."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"""Ebony and Ivory""? I'm afraid that song's taken! By me and my mother. You know, people say when we're on stage, it's more like ""Scary-oke."" Scary talented, I assume."
Seymour Skinner,nostalgia_and_storytelling,"Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day?"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter."
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"Oh, but you love silhouette night! And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions and -- Mother, why are you all dressed up?"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"And you should be. The city's Multicultural Council has invited one lucky student to perform at City Hall. Lisa, you'll be representing us, and the noble Hitachee people!"
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one's for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire.."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Yes, yes. Very good wrath. Ah, let's see, our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Eh... But this is just an empty box!"
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"... so, from now on anything caught in your zipper will be handled by the school nurse, and not me. And now... are you adequately prepared to rock?"
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"Well, I'm going to take advantage of this rare opportunity, even if you children aren't interested. Uh... Which do you think is more important: hard work or stick-to-it-iveness?"
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,I'd like you to give this note to Edna when you get back to class. I don't think I have to tell you it's for her eyes only.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Happy three in the morning, everyone! In a mere five hours, we'll be gazing at Springfield's most exciting glacier, Springfield Glacier. I hope you're all wearing glacier-appropriate clothing."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done. I accept that I killed my mother. My whole life she's belittled me! Maybe deep down... I'm glad."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield Time Capsule...where your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first century...and..."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"First, you're going to give back everything you've stolen, then I'm sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work known to man: janitorial work."
Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"I've just received some rather unusual news regarding your unprecedented A-triple-plus. To be honest, I'm surprised and saddened. No, not saddened, what's the word...? Ah yes, delighted."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Nice job, Simpson. You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player. She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson -- and no Milhouse, for that matter. Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Now peasants, since the middle ages had no compact discs or Super Mario Men, people found entertainment in abusing the village idiot. So, let history come alive!"

Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"Mrs. Krabappel had to go to Portland. Apparently, the people she hired to de-program her sister from that cult turned out to be an even worse cult."

Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to announce the winner of the science fair. Though I must note I'm surprised Lisa Simpson didn't enter a project this year!"

Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"It is with great joy and a sense of once again everything is back to where it started, that we welcome our once and future Groundskeeper... Willie!"

Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Lisa, your outburst was either a sign of deep emotional imbalance, or a passionate response to a sobering truth. Luckily, the treatment for both is intensive therapy."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"This globe will never spin again. Now, class, I want you to be creative with your video projects. I don't want to see thirty ""Blair Witch"" knock-offs."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"And it's all thanks to Donny here, who can happily live the rest of his life knowing he betrayed the one boy who actually cared about him."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Attention, students. In order to cut down on the rash of embarrassing YouTube videos of our teachers, we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Yes, of course -- I think we can wrangle you a used bicycle. Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy? Bart? Where did he-- My car keys!"
Seymour Skinner,family_romance_loneliness,"We can't continue on like this, trying to build a private relationship in public -- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation. There's no mystery about Willie. Why, he simply disappeared... Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up."

Seymour Skinner,self_deprecation_insecurity,"Now Willie, don't tell anyone I'm trying my stand-up comedy act tonight. If the students find out I'm performing at Floppy's, I'll never live it down."

Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. I know he likes the sleeveless look..."
Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday,"Now normally I wouldn't go near a giant chocolate cake in my dress polyester, but with Bart Simpson safely encapsulated, I'd be delighted to pose."

Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"No, no, no. It's the differences -- of which there are none -- that make the sameness... exceptional. Just tell me what to say!"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back."
Seymour Skinner,crime_danger_violence,"Bart, I'm flabbergasted. Surely you knew, as you were writing your own name in forty-foot-high letters in the field, that you would be caught."
Seymour Skinner,quirky_humor_everyday, It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don't think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize!"

Seymour Skinner,morality_religion_values,"We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy."
Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room."
Seymour Skinner,power_wealth_authority,"Lisa, without corporate sponsorship, we wouldn't be able to teach you the three R's: reading, refreshment and Raspberry Buzz Lite. Get your razz on!"

Seymour Skinner,work_role_management,"Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service."
