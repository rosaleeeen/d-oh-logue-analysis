C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,family_romance_loneliness,,"Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret."
C. Montgomery Burns,morality_religion_values,morality_religion_values,,"Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,self_deprecation_insecurity,crime_danger_violence,,"Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that, too. And if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty of that!"
C. Montgomery Burns,self_deprecation_insecurity,work_role_management,,"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"
C. Montgomery Burns,self_deprecation_insecurity,self_deprecation_insecurity,,"Uh, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love. I bring you fear, famine, pestilence, and..."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,work_role_management,,"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"Oooh, a tough question, but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity. Others are more impressed with my incorruptibility... still others by my determination to lower taxes, and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,quirky_humor_everyday,,"Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that."
C. Montgomery Burns,quirky_humor_everyday,work_role_management,,"Huh? What? And by that I mean, of course, it's time for the Worker of the Week Award.

C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking?

C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker.

C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,family_romance_loneliness,,"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,work_role_management,,"A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson.

C. Montgomery Burns,family_romance_loneliness,power_wealth_authority,,"Go back to your tenements, where the O'Briens live next to the Goldbergs, who rub elbows with Antonellis, and the only thing you have in common is the squalor of your chamber pot. Oh how I hate you! Bye-bye."

C. Montgomery Burns,crime_danger_violence,crime_danger_violence,,"Well, I... you see... it's just is it a crime to want nice things? And then to steal them from a public museum where any gum-chewing monkey in a Tufts University jacket can gawk at them? I think not!"
C. Montgomery Burns,nostalgia_and_storytelling,nostalgia_and_storytelling,,"Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the ""trouble ball"" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."

C. Montgomery Burns,quirky_humor_everyday,crime_danger_violence,,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"

C. Montgomery Burns,power_wealth_authority,power_wealth_authority,,"Ironic, isn't it Smithers? This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you."
C. Montgomery Burns,morality_religion_values,power_wealth_authority,,"Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head."
C. Montgomery Burns,self_deprecation_insecurity,crime_danger_violence,,"Smithers Sr. gave his life to save the plant. And, since cover-ups were all the rage back then, I shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe. I never told Smithers the truth about his father."
