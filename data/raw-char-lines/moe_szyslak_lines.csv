Moe Szyslak,"Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?"
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe's Tavern. Hold on, I'll check. ... Hey everybody! I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
Moe Szyslak,"Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
Moe Szyslak,Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons.."
Moe Szyslak,"No dice. The ""Flaming Moe"" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on. I'll check. Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men's room for a Hugh Jass."
Moe Szyslak,"Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I'll check. Uh, Bee O'Problem. Bee O'Problem. C'mon, guys. Do I have an O'Problem here?"
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
Moe Szyslak,Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?
Moe Szyslak,"That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?"
Moe Szyslak,"I think I can provide that service. Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book?"
Moe Szyslak,"Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello?"
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer, you can't take any more of my money. I'm, uh, outta the bookie business."
Moe Szyslak,Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, just a sec, I'll check. Amanda Huggenkiss! Hey, I'm looking for Amanda Huggenkiss! Why can't I find Amanda Huggenkiss!"
Moe Szyslak,"You little S.O.B., if I ever find out who you are I'm gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt!"
Moe Szyslak,"I wasn't really gonna kill ya'. I was just gonna cut ya! Aah, forget it. Ouch, I better go check on Barney."
Moe Szyslak,"Ivana Tinkle. Just a sec. Ivana Tinkle. Ivana Tinkle. All right, everybody put down your glasses. Ivana Tinkle."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, they shouldn't have been there in the first place. But Homer is a real hero."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, well look who it is. Mr. ""I don't need alcohol to enjoy life."" We hate him, right fellas?"
Moe Szyslak,It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin' restless.
Moe Szyslak,"What?... What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'. I'm gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You'll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!!"
Moe Szyslak,"You know, you really irritate me, Skinner. What with your store-bought haircut and excellent posture."
Moe Szyslak,"If this gets out, the next words you say will be muffled by your own butt."
Moe Szyslak,Are you talkin' to me? There's no one else here. You must be talkin' to me.
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question. We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in, ah... you know, one of them loser countries."
Moe Szyslak,"Come to papa... Wait a minute! You have a straight flush, Homer. Go! You do this every time. You... oh, you, ah, ... I'm choking on my own rage here."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, here's the four one one, folks. Say some gangsta is dissin' your fly girl. You just give him one of these."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, why don't you just nibble her elbow. That always melts her butter, right?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself Oh boy, I'm gonna start bawling, here."
Moe Szyslak,"I uh, well... I never touched her, Homer. Homer, I swear, I never touched her."
Moe Szyslak,"I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!"
Moe Szyslak,"Lemme check. Phone call for Al, Al Caholic. / Uh, Jacques Strap! / Is I Pee Freely here? / Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Uh, Homer Sexual / My Crotch / A Amanda Huggenkiss? / A Huge Ass / ""Ivanna Tinkle"" / I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, geez... really ya think so? All right, give 'em back. Come on, everybody give 'em back."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family and I'll give you a beer!"
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, it's Moe. Ah, look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward."
Moe Szyslak,"It's not so bad, Homer. They go in through your nose. And they let you keep the piece of brain they cut out."
Moe Szyslak,"What? What? A bartender can't come by and say ""hi"" to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair."
Moe Szyslak,"And how are the little kids doin'? I mean really how are they doin'. Any disabling injuries? Something, say, that the gambling community might not yet know about? Come here, let me see those knees."
Moe Szyslak,But Blanche! You gotta help me out here. Please! I'm sixty-four grand in the hole. They're gonna take my thumbs!
Moe Szyslak,"How can you judge this man, without talking to the people who know him best. We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the biddin' starts at ten G's."
Moe Szyslak,"Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ow! A snake in the cash register. Great prank, fellas, great. Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm burnin' up, here. Ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. It's funny and it makes you think."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer. You should have thought of that before you gave me the old sugar-me-do. I'm taking your caricature down from Mt. Lushmore."
Moe Szyslak,Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold that someday a Chosen One will...
Moe Szyslak,"And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and uh, you all try to guess what it is."
Moe Szyslak,"Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey! Are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? Now let's do this thing."
Moe Szyslak,MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ DRINK IT DOWN/ YA STUPID CLOWN/ MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ THEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS... WHOA!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, an English boy, eh? You know we saved your ass in World War Two."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, when I call your name, ah, you say present, or here. No, say present. Anita Bath?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, what are you laughin' at? What? Oh, oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well children, I can't help that!"
Moe Szyslak,"That guy sure likes his fresh air. None of that for me. Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'm gonna have to charge ya."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?"
Moe Szyslak,"Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. Sears catalog."
Moe Szyslak,"No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think."
Moe Szyslak,"You stole my bit! You... That's my bit ya... Ya... ooh, ooh, you stole my bit!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table."
Moe Szyslak,Everybody is goin' to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?"
Moe Szyslak,I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
Moe Szyslak,"If you like good food, good fun, and a whole lotta crazy crap on the walls, then come on down to ""Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag."""
Moe Szyslak,"Now that's ""Moe"" like it. So bring the whole family - mom, dad, kids. Uh, no old people. They're not covered by our insurance. It's fun! And remember our guarantee: If I'm not smiling when your check comes, your meal's on me, Uncle Moe."
Moe Szyslak,Here ya go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank ya Ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am! While you eat!
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, nah, nah. Let me level with you, Marge. That's just our name for bottom-feeding suction eel. You don't want that."
Moe Szyslak,Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili? I start with the best part -- the neck. And then I add secret hobo spices.
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children. It cuts through me like a dentist's drill. But no, no, that was funny, that was funny, takin' away my dignity like that. Ha ha ha."
Moe Szyslak,Here ya go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank ya Ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am! While you eat!
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, your ""teef"" hurt, huh? Your ""teef"" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! You hear me? I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' ""sodie, too!"""
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, come on folks! Wait! Please, come back! Please! I got a new offer! Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak... fish."
Moe Szyslak,"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
Moe Szyslak,Yayyy! / Way to go! / The Pin Pals did it! / We won! / Team work! /
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants."
Moe Szyslak,"COME ON HOMER, COME ON HOMER / PRETEND THIS IS BASEBALL / AND HIT US A HOMER!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything."
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him from bowling with us tonight. Heh, heh, heh..."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, he's gonna ruin everything. All right, that's it Homer! Either Burns goes or Moe goes."
Moe Szyslak,"You know what? We don't need him or his trophy. We got each other, huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, the little cutie wants to do something cute... Shut up, ya bums, shut up! Go ahead, angel."
Moe Szyslak,"Good God. Homer, y'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit."
Moe Szyslak,"""Evil blood-thirsty pirate""... Hello, Town Jubilation Committee? I got something that's going to make you a lot less jubilant."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, so you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely off the truck."
Moe Szyslak,"Say, ah, Barn. Remember when I said I'd have to send away to NASA to calculate your bar tab?"
Moe Szyslak,"You owe me... 70 billion dollars. No, wait, wait, wait... Oh, that's uh, for the Voyager Space Craft. Your tab's 14 billion dollars."
Moe Szyslak,"Come back here, you stinkin' -- Hey, I wonder how much air is in here."
Moe Szyslak,"Immiggants?! I knew it was them! Even when it was the bears, I knew it was them!"
Moe Szyslak,"Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language."
Moe Szyslak,"Fun's over, fellas. If you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum."
Moe Szyslak,"Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down."
Moe Szyslak,"There ya go! That's the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! Y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!"
Moe Szyslak,"Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career, I wantcha to have complete faith in me. C'mere, lemme show ya somethin'..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office."
Moe Szyslak,"Yep. They called me ""Kid Gorgeous."" Later on, it was ""Kid Presentable."" Then ""Kid Gruesome."" And finally, ""Kid Moe."""
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
Moe Szyslak,"'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics..."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
Moe Szyslak,"That's right. And if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a coupla times."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with 'em than I did."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that's the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that ""The Stinger."" They... they don't let you use that no more."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don't do nothin', okay? You don't wanna get drawn into a boxing match here."
Moe Szyslak,"Lucius! Hey, what's a glitterati like you doin' in my dump? I--I thought you were managing the Champ."
Moe Szyslak,"I gotta be honest with ya, Homer. I didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper."
Moe Szyslak,Great. All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum. It's this Saturday. Here's your parking pass.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! I'm not the villain here, okay? If Homer gets killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative attitude! There, I said it."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, let 'em be mad. The only thing that matters to me is, you're safe."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, what do dreams matter, Marge? I was able to stick up for a pal."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I, uh... what was the third thing you said?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, ha ha, you got me, didn't ya? All right, here you go -- ""Red Tick Beer."""
Moe Szyslak,"Just a second, Homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home."
Moe Szyslak,"Can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? Midge, help me out here."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, lessee now... uh, time was, you'd send a boy off to war. Shootin' a man'd fix him right up. But there's not even any wars no more thank you very much Warren Christopher!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!"
Moe Szyslak,"Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot nothin' but trophy bucks, huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down. Oh, boy, it looks like it's suicide again for me."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right, listen up! This is the busiest drinkin' day of the year. Where are the designated drivers?"
Moe Szyslak,"A raid?! Curly?! Um, all right, but, uh, I don't know what you... expect to find in a simple, uh, neighborhood...pet shop."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer! My customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! You gotta get me more beer!"
Moe Szyslak,"Look, find it, buy it, make it, I don't care. Just get me some booze, and fast!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well listen, lady. I've got so many problems, I.... I don't even know where to begin here."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither."
Moe Szyslak,"No, it's true. I've got their names written down right here, in what I call my, uh, ""enemies list""."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I don't need no advice from no pinball machine. I'll have you know I wrote the book on love."
Moe Szyslak,"""Go near Moe."" I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement. So, how about you and me go out sometime? You know, out back."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Grampa, but I gotta stash you in the bathroom so Betty won't get wise to us."
Moe Szyslak,"You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking ""attractive"" and ""desirable"". It's just so rare and refreshing."
Moe Szyslak,"Myself? Oh, geez. Um, I gotta go to the can again. I got the runs."
Moe Szyslak,"Um, ah, oh, g... I might as well come clean with ya. I ain't too good at talking to women, and... and I really wanted to do ya, so I brought along the love tester to help me. As you may have guessed, it's inhabited by the ghost of my friend's dead father."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 per cent of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I know. But the bad news is we gotta start having designated drivers."
Moe Szyslak,Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah so, last night I was closing up the bar, when some young punk comes in and tries to stick me up."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it coulda been a real ugly situation, but I managed to shoot him in the spine."
Moe Szyslak,"And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no? Well if you're so sure what it ain't, how 'bout tellin' us what it am?"
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer."
Moe Szyslak,What? No. Why? What? Why? What have you heard? Are you implyin' I'm in some sort of financial trouble?
Moe Szyslak,"Sounds like you're having a rough Christmas, Homer. You know what I blame this on the breakdown of? Society."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, listen up, everybody! The Simpsons are the best friends I ever had. So I'm givin' them the tip jar from the bar!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, we hated being mad at ya, Homer, so we decided to make things right."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I'll give you something to cry about, ya loser! You can't catch a football?! Let's see if you can catch a rock!"
Moe Szyslak,"Dammit, it fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in. Oh, I guess it's back to good old fashioned voodoo."
Moe Szyslak,"Hi. How you folks doin'? I'm Moe. Or as the ladies like to call me, ""Hey you, behind the bushes."" Uh, is this thing on?"
Moe Szyslak,"...the last angry clown, the man who spews truth from every orifice, ladies and gentlemen... Krusty!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I don't blame her. No girl wants to end up with a Joe Puke-pail like me."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, uh, how come I ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I don't know, Homer. Women can smell panic. And, uh, right now, I gotta be reekin' of it."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, come on, what's the catch? A gorgeous woman don't just hand ya a free daffydil."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, the part that's showin'. I guess you could have a lot of weird scars, or a fake ass, or somethin'."
Moe Szyslak,"Well... no... no... well... no... not a... lot... I... Gee, I'm sorry. I used to box you know, my brain's... Well, it's in and out."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I... look, I don't suppose... you'd never want to... uh... I dunno... get together sometime?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, what was I thinkin'? A beautiful girl like you and a gargoyle like me. I... I-I'm sorry."
Moe Szyslak,"Really? Hot damn! All right. Don't eat nothin' for the next three days, 'cause I'm takin' you out for a steak the size of a toilet seat!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey! Sabu! Ah, I need another magnum of your best champagne, here, uh? And bring us the finest food you got, stuffed with the second finest."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeahhh, well, I just get so tired of idiots shootin' their mouths off, laughin' and clappin'. Makes you wanna start pokin' eyes out and slashin' guts and kickin' throats..."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, park the dessert cart under this beautiful lady's nose. And charge it all to my Players Club card."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I wanna send her two dozen roses. And I wanna put something nice on the card, like, um, ""Renee, my treasure..."""
Moe Szyslak,"Shut up, or I'll ram a stool down your throat! Ah, nah, nah, no, I don't want that on the card... Well, lemme hear how it sounds... Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out. And charge it to my Players Club card... Maxed out?"
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I really need these flowers, okay? I got a real tenuous hold on my girlfriend here... Hello? Hello?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, that's it. It's all over. Renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no Joe Pinchpenny."
Moe Szyslak,"Hmmm... I need cash, and lots of it. Um, all right, everybody, I'm calling in your bar tabs."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me."
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, Homer! I'm one of your dearest friends! When everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey! Aw, that's great. Now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you ""steal"" my car."
Moe Szyslak,That's the beauty part. Every cop in town's gonna be on the Police Department's Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I'm gonna be right there with 'em.
Moe Szyslak,"Righ-- No, no. Wrong. Listen. While I'm on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. Then when the 10:15 train comes along..."
Moe Szyslak,WHAM! The insurance company pays off five thousand clams. I keep showing Renee the sweet life.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, 'scuse me there, officer? You see my car there? With the rubber hippie daisy? Space 7A?"
Moe Szyslak,The train! D'you hear that? That's the train! Ha! Isn't that the most beautiful sound you ever heard?
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey, what's it doin' there? It was supposed to be on the railroad tracks -- no, I mean... the parking lot."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I wish I could, Homer, but if I change my story, they're gonna throw me in here."
Moe Szyslak,"Ohh, cripes, the puppy-dog look. All right, all right. I'll use the money to bail you out."
Moe Szyslak,"Naw, naw, naw, we're goin' for the real thing. First class all the way. Come on, we can leave tonight."
Moe Szyslak,... So like a coward I let Homer take the rap for the whole scam. And now the only way to clear him is to turn myself in.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's true. That's true, baby. Hmf, it'll be hell being locked away from ya, but I guess I gotta take my medicine. Unless... Unless, I send a letter to the police clearing Homer..."
Moe Szyslak,"We-we-we switch clothes with them, leave 'em in the bar. Then we pour some brandy around. Like so..."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I'm not gonna let anything happen to my two best customers. I'm joining too."
Moe Szyslak,"So Lenny, let's say you pull a thorn out of the Pope's butt and he grants ya one wish. What'll it be?"
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, gee, I was gonna say a night with Joey Heatherton. But an ironed shirt... Damn! That's tempting."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there."
Moe Szyslak,"Ooh. Yeah. And then what happened? Omit no detail, no matter how small or filthy."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, I think we've been polite long enough here. Lenny, what happened with the dame and the bathing suit?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, God. You smokers disgust me. Hey 'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis?"
Moe Szyslak,"So, I round the corner and head down the ointment aisle, when who should I spot? None other than Kent Brockman!"
Moe Szyslak,"Nah. Nah. Just, uh, hop that fence, sneak up and, uh, peek in the window there."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You're really brave to go through with this operation."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, nah, no. Makin' polenta, that's a procedure. You're talkin' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen, I'm just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, I told you not to come 'round here no more till you paid your tab. Or at least cleaned up that mess you made in the bathroom. Now y--"
Moe Szyslak,"Shove off, puke-holes. Get out of there! These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies."
Moe Szyslak,"Bye weeks. Bronco Nagurski didn't get no bye weeks. And now he's dead. Well, maybe they're a good thing."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons ."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, we been runnin' around cheerin' for an hour. Where the hell's the game?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah man, he's makin' us look like a bunch of cheapskates. Whoa whoa. My rope came loose."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, remember, Midge. You feel the need to rage, you call me, right? I won't even get sexual or nothin'. Unless that's what you want. That, that's not what you want, right?"
Moe Szyslak,"Groundskeeper Willie, you know the guy in the skirt? He bought himself a mail-order bride, but he was too cheap to pay the C.O.D., right? So she's still in a crate down at the post office! Wanna go look-see?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, I been meanin' to wash that, but, uh, you know, it's been such a century..."
Moe Szyslak,"But it's me, Moe, wearing a sailor suit. Moe -- with a lolly. It's so out of character. Ain't that worth nothin'?"
Moe Szyslak,"""You have been chosen to join the Justice Squadron! 8 a.m. Monday at the Municipal Fortress of Vengeance."" Oh, I am so there!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, thanks. It's just past the end of the bar, next to the heavyset guy."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just saying you ain't no, uh, Tommy Tune."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, a duel? I, ah-- Isn't that a little extreme? Here, here, have a free beer."
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, Homer. I never seen you so depressed. As your life partner, I'm very worried."
Moe Szyslak,I'm a little worried. He usually stops in for an eye-opener on the way to work.
Moe Szyslak,"Wow. Anyway, you don't think he could be at another bar, do you? Because I couldn't take that! I... uh... I-I just couldn't! I..."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, you know I can't sell you no beer till two P.M., on accounta it's Sunday."
Moe Szyslak,Sorry. Two P.M. Or you can steal a boat and sail out to International Waters.
Moe Szyslak,"No, the ocean. Once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. That's where they held the Tyson/Secretariat fight."
Moe Szyslak,"No, I really mean it, though. I mean if it was you that died, I would have been on her so fast..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's enough there, 'Pu. Look, Ned, I know we ain't hung out much, what with your insane fear of drinking and me being banned from the church and all, but ah... but that Maude, she was really something."
Moe Szyslak,"That's good, no. Let it out. That's it. Let it out. Send me to Maude. That's it. Oh, here I come, baby. Oh, yeah."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that's great. Thank you, thanks a lot. Ah, I just wanna say that it was an honor for me to compete with the Mick and the uh, the chick with the rack, there."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, I've been meanin' to get that updated, uh, for this state, and real. Now let's see the poster boy for the new Moe-lennium."
Moe Szyslak,I can't believe they put those stickers over my face. I must be the ugliest man alive.
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, c'mon, look at me. I'm a gargoyle. What, with the cauliflower ear there, and the lizard lips..."
Moe Szyslak,"Plastic surgery, huh?... Ah, maybe they could dynamite Mount Crapmore here and carve me a new kisser."
Moe Szyslak,"What? I'm a monster, right? I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, periodically emerging to sue you."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, did you hear that? She called me handsome. Me. It's like I've gone to heaven... Wait a minute. I died on the operating table, didn't I?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'."
Moe Szyslak,"It all goes back to my acting days. I was auditioning for the role of Dr. Tad Winslow on the hit soap, ""It Never Ends."""
Moe Szyslak,Remember me? Twenty-five years ago you said I was too ugly to play Dr. Tad Winslow!
Moe Szyslak,"Cleo, Cleo, you've brought music to my heart, but this relationship can never work. I'm a doctor, and you're a 5,000-year-old mummy I brought back to life."
Moe Szyslak,"It's against hospital regulations, dammit! And Clive Dancer's just waitin' for me to slip up."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, if you must grope me, ladies, please, a little softer. Okay, now harder."
Moe Szyslak,I didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.
Moe Szyslak,I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, hey, I gotta gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching. And I... the feeling is indescribable."
Moe Szyslak,Precisely. Then I get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow!
Moe Szyslak,"Well, if they're gonna stomp on my dreams, the least I can do is go out in a blaze of sour grapes."
Moe Szyslak,"Get ya hands off me. Get off! I don't need your stinkin' show, anyway. With a mug like this, I can get on any soap in Springfield."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters..."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I guess that wraps it up. Hey, there's one thing I don't get, though. When my face was crushed, why did it go back to my old face? I mean, shouldn't it have turned into some kind of third face that was different? Heh. Don't make no..."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, that's it, baby. All for Moe. Oh, yeah. Work the slot. Show me the package."
Moe Szyslak,And I got ya helicopter flying lessons. Can you imagine this boozebag at the wheel of a whirlybird?
Moe Szyslak,"Well, the handwriting's on the wall. To stay afloat, this bar's gonna have to go queer."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer. Ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. Take this seat, right next to the tap."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow and these uhhh... seven presents I brung. Eh, you know what? Cram some shrimp in, too. Head to tail. That way you can fit more."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer stole our rock performance. That fat, dumb and bald guy sure plays some real hardball."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, no menus! Or I'll cut ya like a box -- along the flaps!"
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how Lisa is, ah,... how do I put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city."
Moe Szyslak,"I dunno if I want you in here no more, Homer, uh... I got a lotta secrets I'd prefer to keep clandestine. Terrible, disturbing secrets."
Moe Szyslak,And I was a lot happier before I knew Dame Edna was a man. A lot happier.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, it don't hurt no more. Heh. Now I can focus on my crippling emotional pain. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why? Why won't you hug me? You hug the mailman."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, these, aah, they're just painted on, there. Your choices are beer and, ah... egg soakin's."
Moe Szyslak,"Oooh, boy. All right, let's see here, uh... Well I was born in Indiana... so that ain't it. And, uh... I better call my Lifeline."
Moe Szyslak,"Well... Gee, I really do love currency... but, um, I think I'm gonna play it safe and stick with what I got."
Moe Szyslak,"They bought 'em a year ago, from the Mafia. It was the last of the family-owned teams."
Moe Szyslak,No problem. Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
Moe Szyslak,"Wait a minute, Homer. If it's true, what about all the stuff you weren't around for?"
Moe Szyslak,"That is the stupidest story I ever heard, and I've read the entire Sweet Valley High series. Ha. I am sick of you drunks and your shaggy dog stories."
Moe Szyslak,"But, can you blame me? Every day it's the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin' tip."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, who am I kiddin'? I ain't smiled for real since I nailed that rat with the ice pick. Ha, remember that?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I put this up recently, and it's a good thing I did, 'cause it really illustrates my point. Yep, good ol' Swigmore U."
Moe Szyslak,What's the word I'm searching for? Uh... yeah! A trip to the alma mater might really rekindle my love of gettin' people loaded.
Moe Szyslak,"... And if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell."
Moe Szyslak,"Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending. I, when I first saw the movie Ironweed, I thought, ya know ""this is for me."" But now, well, I'm not so sure."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, don't you wanna take your shoes off before you go swimming? Professor? Oh. Oh. Um. Mm."
Moe Szyslak,"And now, I want you to meet the guy who's gonna help bring Moe's into the twentieth century."
Moe Szyslak,We don't serve Duff no more. We got a Malaysian beer that's better than Duff... It's made outta soy sauce.
Moe Szyslak,"How could I toss my friends out into the cold, with no place to get liquored up?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, here we go. It also says, ""a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."""
Moe Szyslak,"Listen, I don't like you and you don't like me. But we both want to stop Homer from shootin' a turkey."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, from now on, no talkin'. If you want to signal me, use this bird call:"
Moe Szyslak,"What? You mean that time he wigged out? Well, uh, gimme some of that Indian memory tea, there and I'll tell you all about it."
Moe Szyslak,"And there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. I mean, who likes getting muddy? It's terrible. Okay, let's go to Moe's now."
Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no. He said Simpson family. I mean, you know, it sounded exciting, but, uh... you know, we, we don't wanna intrude..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah I guess you're right. It's just that I, you know, went to a lot of trouble, you know makin' the envelope and everything..."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, now this first thing is just gonna look like a used Band Aid. And it is. But the rest of this stuff won't make no sense without it. So uh, bear with me."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned."
Moe Szyslak,Oh I really felt there was a connection and I-I would definitely go out with her again.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I really miss the old guy. It was all I could do to put on his jewels."
Moe Szyslak,"And score with his wife every night. Hey, how ya doin', kid? Nice to see ya."
Moe Szyslak,"Ha. Ha. Cute kid. But, just in case you don't kill Hamlet, I put some poison on the food, on the drapes, even on Rosen-Carl and Guilden-Lenny here."
Moe Szyslak,"You sure you don't want a nice piece of fish, or to finger the drapes a little?"
Moe Szyslak,"I gotta admit, I-I'm kinda nervous, here. We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, we've all got that voice in our heads telling us to kill. You just have to drown it out."
Moe Szyslak,"I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better."
Moe Szyslak,"Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser..."
Moe Szyslak,"Telegram for Heywood U. Cuddlemee. Heywood U. Cuddlemee? Big guy in the back, Heywood U. Cuddlemee? He-- Ooh, that little... Ooh! I'm gonna drive a golden spike where your union meets your central pacific. Stop."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart."
Moe Szyslak,This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy.
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, listen Marge, how can I put this delicately? I don't got enough booze in this place to make you look good."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, you can't throw us out. I just made a Cornish game hen with chestnut stuffing. Would you believe a pigeon stuffed with Spam? Would you believe a rat filled with cough drops?"
Moe Szyslak,"You tell her, Big H! / You da man! / Eh, you ain't so hot."
Moe Szyslak,"Can't your old buddy Moe stop by with a list of questions from the Weekly World News? Number one: Sara, is it true you shoplifted a kayak?"
Moe Szyslak,"Another scoop. Sara Sloane to attend girl-on-girl book club. Moe, you loveable loser, you just made yourself five dollars!"
Moe Szyslak,The government wants to shut me down 'cause the pipes under my toilet don't lead nowhere.
Moe Szyslak,"No one's ever won Moe's ""Drink A Gallon Of Gin Challenge."" And no one ever will."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, he was drinkin' at Harrigan's Bar down the street, there. They oughtta close that dump down."
Moe Szyslak,MOE MOE MOE / HOW DO YOU LIKE ME? / HOW DO YOU LIKE ME? / MOE MOE MOE / WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME? / NOBODY LIKES ME...
Moe Szyslak,"No, no, don't get up, sweetheart. I'll just, I'll just pick around you. There we go."
Moe Szyslak,Huh. Hey maybe this is a sign. Maybe it's time for me to get out of the alcohol business. Give barber college another try -- and this time I won't join a frat.
Moe Szyslak,"You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha, anyway, what's goin' on?"
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, no point in mopin' around. I might as well join 'em and have a jolly old time."
Moe Szyslak,"Here I am, one of the crowd. I'm comfortable I'm calm. If anybody looks at me I got a hypodermic full of bleach."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen to those lucky people, enjoying that pretty flower. I got nothin' -- just this can."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I was in the neighborhood and uh, thought I'd, y'know, check in on Maggie."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, look at that. That's so soft and thoughtful and what's the gag? Is it full of chiggers?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Mag. Raggedy Andy over there has been giving you the button-eye. I'll get rid of him. All right, come on. Out you go."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no problem. You know, it-it gave me kind of a good warm feelin'. Like when you get drunk and fall asleep in the snow."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I was gonna erase those two apostrophes and replace 'em with 'g's, but that's about it. So, you know, call anytime."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, great. Uh, well why don't you play with the baby while I go rent a room?"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, we won't tell no one about that. Now let's see, what else can we do? We can't tickle Elmo no more."
Moe Szyslak,"Hm. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" huh? This must be a take-off on that ""Alice in Underpants"" movie I saw."
Moe Szyslak,It's so nice to be with someone who can't understand the horrible things I say.
Moe Szyslak,"White rabbit... chicks poppin' mushrooms... this is like the Playboy Mansion. Maybe I can think of a story uh, more suitable for a baby."
Moe Szyslak,"And the Godfather's playing with his grandson, see. So he sticks an orange in his mouth, like this."
Moe Szyslak,"Don Bardzini gets whacked. Tessio, Ohh... you won't see him no more. Moe Greene: Bam! He gets it right in the eye. And Michael is now the new Godfather. And he shuts the door on Annie Hall."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no, no baby. No, no... Okay, Part Two. Little Anthony's having his first communion at Lake Tahoe. Meanwhile Michael can't get a gaming license. But Senator Geary's got one weakness: call girls..."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, there she is, the birthday girl. Oh, your mommy tied a bow for you, huh. I'd better retie it -- the way you like it."
Moe Szyslak,"I know it don't seem like it matters, but you know, she hates lookin' like crap."
Moe Szyslak,"It's Uncle Moe's Play Tavern, with classic drunk Barney. Look, even the little toilet is broken."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, you never cared about Maggie 'til I started paying attention to her. Last night at the bar you called her ""Raquel."""
Moe Szyslak,"Is that uh, ""get out"" like leave, or ""get out"" as in: ""Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"""
Moe Szyslak,"Maybe I can catch a late show of ""Alice In Underpants."" Or maybe ""Put 'em on the Looking Glass."""
Moe Szyslak,"Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth."
Moe Szyslak,"You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I gotta get home. There might be a telemarketer calling or something. I'll see you when you're old enough to drink, okay, Magpie."
Moe Szyslak,"Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer's heart that he's been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... God bless ya."
Moe Szyslak,"How much to have Bart crank-call me? That would be hilarious. Eh, that's just me, though. You know, I love to laugh."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, wait a minute. Dirty words you can spell on your calculator is a very important subject."
Moe Szyslak,"I will! And then you'll all wish you was nicer to me! Eh, who am I kiddin'? I ain't gonna jump."
Moe Szyslak,"Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham? All right, I'll order. Um, I'll have a medium pepperoni. And can you space out the meat so it spells ""happy birthday Moe""? Oh, God I'm alone."
Moe Szyslak,"Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. If you make it through the night, you're welcome back."
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry, sir. The maid and I will take him out to the curb. C'mon, c'mon."
Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. How can you arrest Homer? This guy's the one what done the thing that why you're here for. I'm talkin' malfeasance here.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, well look who showed his face. The louse who sold out his only friend. You've got a lot of nerve comin' here... but since you did, what'll it be? First one's on the house."
Moe Szyslak,"You know, they say that the love of a good woman can save any man."
Moe Szyslak,"All I got is this old stuff here. Chateau Latour -- eighteen eighty-six? Oh, I should just throw this out."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide."
Moe Szyslak,"What? It's 'cause of her I put in a bidet. Well, it's actually just a step ladder by the water fountain."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, look. I've been in the bartender business for a long time alright, I've heard it all."
Moe Szyslak,"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh my God -- we're sealed in! Hey, nobody breathe my air -- get your own!"
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn't have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety."
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry, chicks love that kind of thing -- patches, scars, stumps... Everything but zits."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, don't you try and prank me with a fake name -- I'll rip out your intestines and use 'em to make a lanyard... Hello? Hello?"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, well, I really enjoyed being you, Dr. Hibbert. Uh, oh by the way, you're not welcome in the library no more. I'm sorry."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer... this bar's only for real Americans. And people on permanent visas, like me. What? What are you all lookin' at? I'm Dutch. Eh, forget all of you."
Moe Szyslak,Looks like me and Marge are both goin' to Hell. That's when I make my move.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah thanks. I bought this for my funeral. It ain't got no back, so don't make me turn around."
Moe Szyslak,"Guys, this is Frankie from the Health Department. We go way back. Lenny, you don't have to hide that rat."
Moe Szyslak,"When we were kids, our dads used to get drunk and make us fight each other."
Moe Szyslak,"That time you blinded me, he gave you a bike. That sure was a good soundin' bike..."
Moe Szyslak,"It's too late -- I don't got the cash to clean up the bar. From now on, you guys are gonna hafta do your drinking across the street."
Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Homer. No one's ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn't have."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, now wait just a minute. One thing Moe Szyslak has never had is a partner. Nor a wife, a friend, a chum, a casual acquaintance, a pen pal, a parrot, a meaningful conversation, a brief hug or eye contact."
Moe Szyslak,I'm just going to call the suicide hotline now. And they've blocked my number! Oh God!
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I like Moe's the way it is, all right? And I ain't changin' it for any dame, skirt, Susie-Q, or face-macer."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh... MY BAR COULD BE BRITISH / INSTEAD OF ARM-PITTISH / SO WHY DON'T WE ALL Eh, screw it."
Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Freakazoid. I'd just like to say that there's one person to whom I really owe my newfound success: Marge Simpson."
Moe Szyslak,"Marge, sorry to call you so late but I had a great idea: put cutesy signs outside the restrooms that say ""dukes"" and ""dames"" instead of the ones we have now that say ""standups"" and ""sitdowns."" Huh? Tell me honestly, what do you think?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh yeah, how ya doin' there, Homer? Did you ever pass that G.I. Joe you swallowed?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm just excited because they're showin' an episode of ""Boy Meets World"" on this flight. Oh no, wait. That's only on flights from Europe. We just get that little plane."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, time to chase this pig into the sty. Uh Marge, you deserve a man who listens to you. Who respects you. Who understands what a treasure you really are."
Moe Szyslak,"Hot damn, I won! Marge, I swear I'll be the best man you ever had. It's gonna be all flowers and back rubs and how-was-your-day dear and--"
Moe Szyslak,At least I had a couple sips from your coke when you went to the bathroom.
Moe Szyslak,"Might as well face it, I'll never find anyone. Come on tide -- take me with ya. I just don't wanna feel no more pain."
Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Marge... Know-it-all bitch. Oh, uh, did I mention there was a mistake at the front desk?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, them gay guys got lots of disposable income. I can serve fancy drinks and charge ten bucks a pop. What's in a martini?"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, now let's say I put a Lean Cuisine in a blender and I pour some beer on it. What do you call that?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, how 'bout we open a fancy restaurant, and when people check their hats and coats, we steal 'em?"
Moe Szyslak,"This ain't for you, sweat stain. It's a surprise party for Lenny, thrown by his closest friends."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I was wonderin' if you could help save my soul. I've done stuff I ain't proud of. And the stuff I am proud of is disgusting."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, funny thing, that. You said the end was comin', so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen and gave the money to charity. Now them orphans got new skip ropes, and I end every day smelling like eel. Cats are all over me. Thank you, though. You did me a solid."
Moe Szyslak,Are you kiddin'? Homer's the one what wised us up to the sexy goin's on.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh God, here it comes -- time-share pitch. Well I got bad credit, so the joke's on you!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, before I die, I'll just scratch that lottery ticket I got in my pocket."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, long story. Uh, we were trying to impress some girls -- and things kinda got away from us."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, are you callin' my life-partner a sissy? 'Cause a hundred bucks says he could whup you in arm wrestling."
Moe Szyslak,"Yes! Homer, we make a dynamite team, huh? With your arm, and my head-gunk, we're goin' right to the top! Whoa."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, if we get bored on the bus, I got a book of brain teasers here. Let's see... oh, ""Brothers and sisters have I none, but this man's father is my father's son."" Huh. Screw you, you stupid thing!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin."
Moe Szyslak,"Now Homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? Your first opponent is Lefty ""The Righty"" Leftwright."
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, Homer! We can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the Eastern Division, Class B, over thirty-five, Amateur Grouping!"
Moe Szyslak,HERE COMES THE MOE / WITH A PRETTY GIRL / 'CAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED / IN RE-AL LIFE
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, you're doin' great. You're way ahead in the polls... even those negative campaign ads aren't hurting you."
Moe Szyslak,This says I ain't allergic to pollen. So I could'a gone to the park and played with other kids. I gotta make up for lost time!
Moe Szyslak,"SITTIN' IN A ROCKING CHAIR / EATING BABY CRACK-ERS / TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, BANANA / A-B-C-D-E-F-G / WASH THOSE JUNE BUGS OFF OF ME"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, ya remember that time I tried to hang myself and the rope broke? Well, I sued the rope company and got a huge settlement... and a new rope!"
Moe Szyslak,"I don't get this. This guy paints his noggin and you guys are ready to buy pants. Meanwhile, I been payin' for that billboard outside for a year now, and it's not yieldin' nothin'!"
Moe Szyslak,"If you're reading this, I am dead, and you are about to learn the story of my treasure."
Moe Szyslak,"...I was headin' to the restaurant supply store to buy some urinal-cake mix, when I was suddenly sideswiped by love."
Moe Szyslak,"I see you're new to town -- maybe I could uh, show you around? I know a terrific tavern..."
Moe Szyslak,"Me? Well, I, uh, for a living? Well, there's all kinds of things a fella can do, such as... hemming, and hawing, and uh, but me, I'm a highly respected uh... therapist for alcoholics."
Moe Szyslak,"I knew that in order to win her love, I needed to get rid of the human garbage otherwise known as my best friends."
Moe Szyslak,"For one sweet summer, I was a true gentleman. As a result of which, Krabappel was lettin' me do her."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen booze-bags, I got a good thing goin' here. If you mess it up, I will ""out"" the one of you that is gay."
Moe Szyslak,"I had to get Edna out of Springfield -- make a fresh start in a new town, far away. A place where we can play bridge with our neighbors. And if they're interested in wife-swapping, who am I to say no? I'm just the new guy."
Moe Szyslak,"But where would I get the money to start a new life? And then, opportunity strolled right in the door..."
Moe Szyslak,"See, this was back before Snake became a notorious jailbird, when he was an idealistic, law-abiding young archaeologist."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, you can't donate that gold to the museum today, 'cause um... uh it's closed, so they can clean under the wangs on the statues."
Moe Szyslak,Love had handed me an awful dilemma. Should I rob this guy or rob him and kill him?
Moe Szyslak,"Before we left town for good, we hadda make one stop -- so she could tell the school she wouldn't be teachin' there."
Moe Szyslak,"I was the happiest guy in the world. But fate likes to play a little game called ""Up Yours, Moe."""
Moe Szyslak,"If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, you'll take it -- and then you'll give it to me, if you know what's good for ya."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Lenny, I see you cut the celery at an angle, here! Makes my straight-cut celery look like crap."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Buck! Howzit feel knowin' your wife's turning on a creep like me? Weird, I bet?"
Moe Szyslak,"I knew it! I knew it! So uh, do I win a Jock Squawk t-shirt?"
Moe Szyslak,"Look Mister, I-I-I don't got the cash. My clientele -- they're all bums. They never pay!"
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!"
Moe Szyslak,"Everyone relax, huh -- I know the Heimlich. I learned it a few years ago. It was nineteen ninety-seven, and ""Titanic"" was proving unsinkable at the box office..."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay boys, we're under attack! Let's drive 'em out of town the way we did with the Irish!"
Moe Szyslak,Now I'm thinkin' about ping-pong... a very fast chess game... a snappy David Mamet play...
Moe Szyslak,"I sure am looking forward to my birthday fishing trip... Well I'll see ya soon, this is Moe, big day... uh, waitin', feeling uh, kind of fragile... Moe, the birthday boy, listenin' for your car..."
Moe Szyslak,HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / I FEEL SO DAMN LONELY / WON'T SOMEONE KILL ME AND MANY MORE...
Moe Szyslak,"Birthdays never meant squat to me. Then you offered to take me fishing, and like a stumblebum chump, I dared to hope. But you shattered my dreams like a Duff tallboy in a bar brawl. And you jammed the jagged neck right up my heart's butt."
Moe Szyslak,"Wow, for the first time in my life, someone's taking a genuine interest in what's inside of me. Suddenly, this is my best birthday ever!"
Moe Szyslak,"How come you wanna do a report on me? I ain't no great man, like Bob Seger or Haystacks Calhoun."
Moe Szyslak,"That's a terrific title! It jumps out at you like a rat in your underwear drawer. We make a great team there, Liser."
Moe Szyslak,...my soul smells like a dead pigeon after three weeks. / I shut my window and go to sleep. / In my dream I eat corn with my eyes.
Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait, wait -- then that guy wasn't squeezin' my 'roids when he invited me to the Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?"
Moe Szyslak,"You ever scrub your hands real fast, and think you're seein' a third one? One time I looked down and there really was. I gotta get a new lock for that bathroom."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well uh I-I, was just saying that um...I thought it up all by myself."
Moe Szyslak,"I dunno... the only book I ever read was ""Super Hounds: The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System"". So uh... any of you wetnaps write that?"
Moe Szyslak,"I need a brilliant new poem for the farewell dinner. So if you could turn these into one of those and then don't say nothin' while I take all the credit, I'd really appreciate it, though I'd never admit that. And look, I got you started. Eh? Eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Look at me. It's supposed to be my big triumph and I'm standing in mud, fightin' with geese. Well, if I'm gonna fight, I might as well win."
Moe Szyslak,"Look at me, sittin' here depressed when I'm surrounded by the happiest people in the world: writers."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, this here poem is called ""Elevator Capacity."" ""Elevator capacity twenty-four hundred pounds. Inspection Certificate available in hotel manager's office..."""
Moe Szyslak,Ode to Lisa: Pointy-headed mini-muse. / More friend than I deserved. / You pulled me from the dirt / and made me the beautiful flower that I am.
Moe Szyslak,"But some flowers can stab you in the back. / For which I should send you flowers. / Which I will, but they were closed. / You'll be gettin' them tomorrow."
Moe Szyslak,"Lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in Vermont. Except for those two dudes I saw gettin' hitched. Not my thing, but I wish 'em well."
Moe Szyslak,"That's right, tell me all your little wooden dreams. You're not alone any more. No you ain't."
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Declan? Did a cop give ya a ticket for talkin' like a fruit?"
Moe Szyslak,Whaddaya been sippin' cuckoo juice? Homer's got it made. He's married to one hell of a woman. All I've got is this porn channel I'm too cheap to de-scramble.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: ""Pontiff No Return"". I came up with it, but I don't really get it."
Moe Szyslak,"Have you been to Homer's house?! It's got a back yard, a front yard... the place is like yard city!"
Moe Szyslak,I was gonna use it to take secret photos in the ladies' turlet. But no dames ever come in this joint!
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I'm just the bartender here, but it seems to me you could win Lisa back by appealing to her sense of reason. And you could win your Mom back by appealing to her feelings."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, hey that's the guy what created him! If Homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, Midge. You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy. But what can we do about it now? It's not like we can play the game over again."
Moe Szyslak,"That's right, Pu. People owe us because we're heroes. It's even on my business card."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on a second, fellas -- I don't like the looks of that flamin' ember."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, the fire has spread to this room full of valuables. And it's our duty to follow it."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, the fire's out... but uh, I think some of these valuables are smoke damaged. He's not gonna want 'em."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes..."
Moe Szyslak,"First Skinner, now you. Well, maybe you've got a point. Maybe we... ...a solid gold grandfather clock!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh. Then I'll have to charge you extra, depending on the color. Uh, stick out your tongue."
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I was insensitive and I'm sorry. But what this is really about is a bully with a winch."
Moe Szyslak,Oh no. I ain't tippin' some jerk two bucks to tie a TV to my car. Mama Moe didn't raise no fools.
Moe Szyslak,"Was you ever. You came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."""
Moe Szyslak,That means it worked. No one ever remembers. That's why I made this video to explain the process.
Moe Szyslak,"You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog's eye, Absolut Pickle..."
Moe Szyslak,"The point is, this drink is the ultimate brain bleacher. One swig wipes out the last day of your life."
Moe Szyslak,"I got just the drink to wipe your mind clean... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."" Fellas, if you got anything that you want to say to Homer that he'll never remember, say it now."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, when you say broke, do you mean really broke, or uh, ""O.J. Simpson broke?"""
Moe Szyslak,"All right, I need you to get the rats outta the jukebox, and clean the vomit out of the pool table pockets, and then you've got the job. Oh, and you've gotta share your tips with Manuel, who's actually me with a fake moustache."
Moe Szyslak,I'm not leavin'. / Sorry. Not leavin'. / Not quite yet. / I'm sorry. / I'm not leavin'.
Moe Szyslak,I like creating disappointment. You know that little moment where people's hope dies? I feed on that.
Moe Szyslak,"Doreen? She's cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I've showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya..."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, whatever you done to that little girl, you just gotta do something even nicer to win her back."
Moe Szyslak,"So the name ""Lisa Simpson"" is available, huh? Lotta goodwill attached to that name... I'm gonna take it."
Moe Szyslak,Can't. I'm not really a God. I was just acting crazy to get out of jury duty.
Moe Szyslak,"A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer 'em into giving you all their secrets."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, you wanna try my new Vance Connor-politan? Like Vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated."
Moe Szyslak,People like Flanders make me sick. If I was Marge's landlord I'd fix her pipes and I'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the South Seas and I... I'd never return.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, here's how you get back at Flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is."
Moe Szyslak,"Here's how you turn this place around. I let people do things in my bar they can't do nowhere else. You wanna drink on a Sunday morning? No problem. You wanna slow-dance with a goat? I'll be doin' a lot of things, but judgin' ain't one of 'em."
Moe Szyslak,"I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm spiffin' up the place! Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries?"
Moe Szyslak,"It was a typical Friday night: me surfing the net at the public library, with occasional drinking fountain breaks."
Moe Szyslak,I couldn't believe it -- I finally found an intelligent sophisticated woman who hadn't heard any of my knock-knock jokes.
Moe Szyslak,"""You're funny. Very nice. Now, how can I put this? Um... ""Are you sure you're not actually some creepy guy in a public library?"""
Moe Szyslak,"""No. How 'bout you?"" Actually, there is a much creepier guy right next to me."
Moe Szyslak,"I would do anything to chat with Maya, short of actually purchasing a computer. We decided to take the next big step -- exchanging photos..."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, this is it. I finally get to see what she looks like. Dast I click on this j-peg? No. I dasn't."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, she was a knockout. Which meant I was screwed. Because now I had to send her a picture of me."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips..."
Moe Szyslak,"So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, well they're both here, and neither one's your husband. This press conference is over."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, you're a little person? I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. What's the correct term?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh of course, of course. Um, I-I just have to -- I have to tidy up the place! Just one second."
Moe Szyslak,"So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized."
Moe Szyslak,"Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there."
Moe Szyslak,I took out the passenger seat to save gas. But I'm gonna use it now. 'Cause we're gonna do the town!
Moe Szyslak,"...so instead of getting a new bar sign, I saved three hundred bucks by changing my name to Moe..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I practice by siphoning gas out of other people's tanks. But I never tasted super-premium that was half as good as you."
Moe Szyslak,Incredible. I've never felt like this before. It's like my heart wants to do her.
Moe Szyslak,"Let me ask you guys somethin': how would you treat a person who's generally dynamite but uh, in some way... a little different?"
Moe Szyslak,"No, hey, a lot of people live in trees... uh, Tarzan, the Berenstain Bears, flood victims..."
Moe Szyslak,Gah! Why should I be watchin' anything when I could look at the most beautiful thing in the world: youse.
Moe Szyslak,"Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were..."
Moe Szyslak,"Maya... there's something I wanna ask ya, um... I don't know why I'm so nervous... this makes more sense than anything I've ever done... well, other than keepin' all my Netflix movies and sayin' the post office lost 'em. Anyway..."
Moe Szyslak,"And we can drink champagne out of an acorn top. Our first dance will be on the head of a pin! I've been hoggin' all the good ones. All right, now you go. But hey, keep it short!"
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Forgive me, kitten... I mean cat... I mean, tiger... I mean saber-toothed tiger. I mean--"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay. I screwed this up pretty bad and, uh, I'm sorry. How long do you people remember things?"
Moe Szyslak,"Guys, after all the years I've given you advice, now I need a little advice from you."
Moe Szyslak,"I mean take out bones, guts, whatever you gotta do to make me a micro-Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
Moe Szyslak,"So cut me down to size, Doc. And can you wrap up the bones so my dog can have fun with 'em."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, you know, my invitation didn't say nothin' about no towels. So I guess we should all just go ""Scandinavian,"" huh? Huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"I ain't paid for Doris Kearns Goodwin in my life and I ain't gonna start now. Oh, that's some good Doris there."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, but last year I took Barney dressed as Marge. Think how much better they'll think you look."
Moe Szyslak,OH WHY CAN'T NO GIRL LOVE A GUY WITH THIS MUG...WHOSE MOTHER DECLARED / YOU'RE TOO UGLY TO HUG...
Moe Szyslak,JUST ONCE I WISH CUPID / WOULD DRAW BACK HIS BOW / AND SHOOT ME A CUTIE / WHOSE STANDARDS ARE LOW...
Moe Szyslak,"Um, Marge... Homer, uh, just ran out sayin' he don't love you and he never did."
Moe Szyslak,"So, I see we're back in business. Now, a little more hemoglobin and your wife will be disrobin'."
Moe Szyslak,"So Marge, uh... Homer's been gone a whole week, huh? In an unrelated matter, I just put on cologne and shaved my knuckles."
Moe Szyslak,"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns. And it begins, ""Dear Midge: you probably hate me by now, and if you don't, what's wrong which youse? But don't give up on men. Bart, Linda and the other one there need a Dad."""
Moe Szyslak,"Dang, I'm missing the secret ingredient! Uh, lemme squeeze some more out of the ""Secret Ingredient Bag""."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh-oh, looks like I gotta wing it a little bit here. The other day I ran into an Irishman. Oh really? No, O'Reilly."
Moe Szyslak,"Before you do, I just gotta warn you, Marge. MY TASTE FOR ROMANCE IS KINDA PERVERSE / I CAN ONLY MAKE LOVE IN THE BACK OF A HEARSE..."
Moe Szyslak,"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
Moe Szyslak,Now get back to my bar for happy hour or I'll paint the snow pink with your brains!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, uh, so, uh, I guess this means you hillbillies are gonna have your way with me. Huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"No, I thought that we had a connection here, and we're out in the woods and everything, and... hey, forget it. I ain't gonna beg for it."
Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait, wait, don't un-form! You're a great mob -- we'll think of something else to get upset about! How 'bout all that construction on Route One? Huh? Huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"You want to ""buy a round?"" I heard about that in bartending school, but I never seen it happen."
Moe Szyslak,"I don't know. I just go around sayin' that, in the hope it'll be applicable. I'll be on my way now."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, they shouldn't be playing Quidditch at all! Not while four of the seven horcruxes are still unfound!"
Moe Szyslak,It means it's not like you're gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.
Moe Szyslak,"No, you can still turn back! The point of no return is the whispered huddle."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh hey there, Liser. Just oiling the old door here. Finally silenced that mournful wail."
Moe Szyslak,"Springfield, U.S.A. A town where everyone's got a story. I moved here 'cause on a calculator, the zip code spells ""boobs."""
Moe Szyslak,"Anyway, here's my little tale. As the town's bartender, I know everyone's problems. And everyone's got problems -- especially the married ones."
Moe Szyslak,It's a timeless tale of the... hello! Are you seein' what I'm seein' here? Ooh! This omniscient point of view has got some surprising bonuses! Yeah.
Moe Szyslak,"""Dear friends, I have some news that is doubly sad -- first off, I am leaving town forever. And my going away present? One of your wives is running off with me."""
Moe Szyslak,Perhaps I should've told you in person. But there's no easy way to say goodbye forever. So I'll say it the hardest way I can: in Mandarin Chinese. Zai jian yong yuan!
Moe Szyslak,"And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, hey 'Pu. I just want you to know that I got one of your kids here. This ain't a kidnapping thing, but if you're in the mood to give me a million dollars, that's cool. This should not be interpreted by federal agents as a threat. Once again, no threat, but will take the dough."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's probably a good one. Here, I got somethin' that might cheer ya up."
Moe Szyslak,"I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys."
Moe Szyslak,"So uh, would you like to cut one? I mean a rug. Oh God, I always say the wrong thing."
Moe Szyslak,Is the preacher here? 'Cause there's somethin' I gotta get offa my chest. Somethin' more suited for the town gossip than the minister's wife.
Moe Szyslak,"Uh... well, there's this uh, married woman that I have feelings for. And her husband don't realize how upset she is with him."
Moe Szyslak,"I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula."
Moe Szyslak,And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
Moe Szyslak,"So all you mugs out there, be sure you don't take for granted the woman you love. Oh, and it's Mother's Day, so call your ma."
Moe Szyslak,"Take her down to the diner at the department store there. Get her a roast beef on rye. Oh, and make sure she gets a fruit cup on the side -- she's worth it."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw man, you know you're a loser when they don't even work hard on the excuse."
Moe Szyslak,"I don't wanna say it's ugly, but PETA called and said we should kill this one."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, anyone can get a laugh at the expense of an ugly dog. But crazy beards? That's where the big boys play."
Moe Szyslak,I am so not British. Don't let this pasty face and bad teeth fool ya.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it's a helluva city. It's like somebody stepped on New York and scraped it off on the beach."
Moe Szyslak,But it's brought you everything a man could want -- I bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing 'em till the food drops through.
Moe Szyslak,"Wow. I can't believe this, Simon. Simon? Huh. Was he really here, or was it just my imagination?"
Moe Szyslak,...because you should be on Broadway chargin' a hundred bucks a ticket! You're a natural talent!
Moe Szyslak,"I'm gettin' a little emotional here, because your voice, it opened up a little part of me that I thought was closed to truth and beauty forever. If there's a God, I just hope that right now he's votin' your name on that 8-8-8 line. It was, it was really beautiful. Really. Thank you."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out!"
Moe Szyslak,"...I didn't rip out his voice box, but I did stretch out his tee shirt, then they said I ain't allowed back in California no more and I can no longer make judgments about nothin'..."
Moe Szyslak,He seems fine. There is one bright side: I'm also forbidden from ever watchin' Fox.
Moe Szyslak,"Hi, I'm Moe. It's good that little kid left, 'cause this song is gonna get into a very dark area."
Moe Szyslak,"The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, speaking of stats, I'm none too pleased about your ratio of ""seats occupied"" to ""beers ordered."""
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?"
Moe Szyslak,It's just as well. There's no such thing as a Birditarod. It was just a trick to scam you out of your house. Good day.
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doin'? That leads to the daycare center. You take the freight elevator."
Moe Szyslak,You are clearly too smart to be down here with these dingle-bells. I'm promotin' you to Toy Inspector. The rest of youse are laid off. Scram.
Moe Szyslak,"Kid, you got a lot of shoddy, money-saving ideas. Like a major airline but you were here on time. Come with me."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, baby, it's Moe. Calling yaz from my new bachelor pad, at 742 Evergreen Terrace. Yeah, okay, sugarplum. I'll see you soon."
Moe Szyslak,TWENTY-SEVEN EELERS EELING / TWENTY-SIX ANARCHISTS BOMBING / TWENTY-FIVE SWAMIS FORESEEING / TWENTY-FOUR SIDEBURNS CURLING / TWENTY-THREE MONKS A-CHANTING / TWENTY-TWO RATS A-PLAGUING / TWENTY-ONE COXSWAINS CALLING / TWENTY FLAUTISTS FLUTING / NINETEEN FOOTMEN BOWING / EIGHTEEN GUNGAS DINNING / SEVENTEEN SEVENTY-SI-IX / SIXTEEN MIDWIVES BIRTHING / FIFTEEN ALIENISTS ALIENING / FOURTEEN JACKS A-RIPPING / THIRTEEN SCRIVENERS SCRIVNING / TWELVE LORDS A-LEAP--
Moe Szyslak,"Uh listen, Homer -- I know a guy who fixes things for folks who need things fixed. But, uh, I can't talk about it here."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoopsie. Glinda, Madame Morrible, flyin' monkeys there... Can you tell me how I can get back to my bar?"
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... uh, I ain't got nothin' clean to compare it to."
Moe Szyslak,"Why you! I'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a Rubik's cube, which I will never solve!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No offense, uh, but uh, I just ain't comfortable hanging around all night with, uh, y'know whatchamacallit... uh, swishkabobs."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, check that out! / Stuff is getting' done! / Look at them renovations! / And... finished!"
Moe Szyslak,"So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now."
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I've turned this bar into every other kind of bar and it never worked."
Moe Szyslak,"Total disaster. Complete bomb. Utter failure. Uh, dream I painted. And in this economy a man needs to find new customers while keeping his old best friends. So, whaddaya say?"
Moe Szyslak,Gimme that! Don't you dare question the gospel according to Dr. Swig McJigger. He's drinkin' his own brains.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, oh, Grizzly Shawn, that's so nice of you to think of me. But... uh... the Tony Awards are that night and I'll be too keyed up to have fun."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, excuse me, fellas. Excuse me. First of all... thank you. This bar was on its last legs. I was gonna have to move in with ma, who's dead and doesn't have a house. So, would not have been good."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm so sorry, uh, but tonight I've got a long-overdue manscaping. But have fun! 'Cause you're the one that I want."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, it's the bartender's job to agree with the customer. Now enough chitchat, I've gotta put up this new painting."
Moe Szyslak,"Just relax there, Waylon. We got a great thing goin' on. Now we can afford real bowls of pretzels instead of trompe-l'oeil-ing 'em on the bar."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I think if you guys can manage to go into the voting booth one at a time, then I can manage to win!"
Moe Szyslak,"Whew! I thought it was an inventory issue. That's a big relief. Now don't worry, I'll let 'em down easy. In four years!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey there, well... it's my business partner, Mr. Smithers. Nice of you to drop by and not say nothin' that costs nobody no election."
Moe Szyslak,"I am one of them! Hey, I only read Hustler to see the picture of Larry Flynt."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, okay, uh... prepare to be kissed... here we go... giving in to my natural urges... okay, a few jumping jacks just to warm up..."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, everyone. Oh, this is the most embarrassing thing I ever had to say, but... I ain't gay."
Moe Szyslak,"I didn't mean to. At first, I was only gay for your money. And, and I had real, deep feelings for that money. But then I felt accepted by you in a way that I'd never been before. I just wish you people could know what it's like to want acceptance. Well, so who you gonna vote for? Me? Or a republican whose record is so anti-gay, he's clearly secretly super gay."
Moe Szyslak,"Boy, I love Valentine's Day. Stir a drop of JÃ¤germeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it ""Cupid's Ambrosia,"" and you can charge up the wazoo."
Moe Szyslak,"What are you, crazy? Of course I do. I got a hot date. C'mon, scram, so I can get ready!"
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, what have I got to lose? They say for every man, somewhere on Earth there's one woman."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, excuse me, is this the seminar where you learn how to pick up free escorts?"
Moe Szyslak,"Name's Moe Szyslak. As a kid, I had roundworm. Heck, I was more worm than boy for a couple of years. I dabbled in Satanism, until I was asked to leave. Oh, uh, and one month I ate nothing but aquarium fish."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, do somethin' about your dad. He's casting a pall over this grim dungeon full of losers."
Moe Szyslak,"Ooh, a text. Let's see... Text message for I. M. A. Wiener. As you all can see, I. M. A. Wiener!"
Moe Szyslak,"When-I-get-a-hold-of-you... oh dammit, I typed an F, not a D. Uh... Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. Oh crap, I just donated twenty dollars to Haiti!"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay now, don't want no trouble. Let me just get my cash out of my cash drawer here."
Moe Szyslak,"Just, uh, linin' up all the Presidents nice and neat... ain't tryin' to be no hero ..."
Moe Szyslak,"Wow, that's the farthest that one of my eggs ever made it down someone's throat!"
Moe Szyslak,"Don't forget, Christmas is a wonderful time to take up alcoholism. You see your family all year round. The holidays are for your bartender."
Moe Szyslak,"Enjoy. And as for you, Homer, don't worry. You're at Moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three."
Moe Szyslak,I wouldn't join one of your hare-brained schemes for all the Japanese girlfriend pillows in Kyoto!
Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I don't like to brag about it, but I did publish five modestly successful children's books."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, this job's fallin' apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!"
Moe Szyslak,"I don't care if he's the guy who wrote ""Sandman Volume One: Preludes And Nocturnes,"" no one spies on us!"
Moe Szyslak,"I'm payin' extra for this channel? Hasn't been good since ""The Wire."" Aw, who am I kiddin'? I never watched ""The Wire."" Had to bluff my way through so many conversations."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. I keep meaning to switch things around, but this place is always a crime scene."
Moe Szyslak,"Well... uh... well, I just made friends with Pepto-Bismol on Facebook and uh... um... Hey, would ya look at that? There's a spot on the bar!"
Moe Szyslak,"So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Hey, Chief Wiggum! Can you help me find my bar rag?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I, I knew it was something stupid. Well thanks, everybody. I... I'm always gonna remember today as the day that I learned to open my heart to human beings and not old pieces of cloth."
Moe Szyslak,"Sure, sure. I understand. But if you change your minds, I'll be here in this cave."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! There's a white wine? And wha- a Swiss cheese? And a peanut butter? And a potato chip? And toilet paper? Wha-what?!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, you know what's good for cleaning Moe gunk outta your rollers? White vinegar. Yeah--"
Moe Szyslak,"Boy, this place has gotten so grim. I'm gonna do something I've never done: make myself a drink."
Moe Szyslak,You call this beer? This is watered-down swill! You got a problem? Well here's the complaint department!
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I'd love to discuss your problems but a pack of raccoons took over my back room and today's the day I make my stand."
Moe Szyslak,"And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm afraid Lisa's right, son. If the late, great Nora Ephron taught us anything... Oh! What's my other inflatable doll doing here?"
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, you know, in this town, you learn to adjust to things. Runaway monorails... NASCAR star Jeff Gordon..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer... what if you got back one of those samples you sold years ago at the Shelbyville Sperm Bank?"
Moe Szyslak,I'll tell you where you should put your money. The one safe place left in this world of woe:
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we're doin' great!"
Moe Szyslak,"Gentlemen, prepare to meet your various makers there, 'cause we got one last frame by our new anchorman... Dan Gillick."
Moe Szyslak,"So, now you think you can just waltz in here and buy everybody a beer?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I have no idea what you do or who you work with, but I am sure if you put your foot down on their throats and grind until you hear a crunch, they'll sit up straight."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hey, listen, I've learned a lot about human nature by watching things through secret cameras."
Moe Szyslak,"What's wrong, Homer? You've got an expression on your face I ain't never seen before. Like one of them Charlie Brown wiggle-frowns."
Moe Szyslak,"Here ya go, Homer. Boy, y'know, when you're just here alone, I can really smell ya."
Moe Szyslak,"Wow, no one's ever been happy in this place before. And when I started it was Moe's Ice Cream Carnival. Not good."
Moe Szyslak,"I just got a hundred! The tree is real! What you got against hope, anyway?"
Moe Szyslak,Thank God there's no alcohol in this bar or this place would really go up.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire."
Moe Szyslak,"I bet I win a locker full of treasure, like a solid gold bar of silver or Picasso's TV!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I said, um... I said ""Mike Rotch. Um, Mike Rotch."" And then, I... I'm sorry..."
Moe Szyslak,"You see, they, they thought I was askin'... if anybody wanted to see... my... oh man, this is so painful... my crotch."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that. I've been readin' that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give 'em what-for in the bedroom there."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah y'know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular. But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction."
Moe Szyslak,"""Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said: 'now if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole'."" I can't be the only one who likes this."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I've gotta know which of the two true faiths you represent."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses."
Moe Szyslak,"Suicide. Finally. I'm really doin' it. No more cries for helllp! 'Cause this time there's no one that's gonna save me! I mean, it's not like I'm beggin' ya, please, please show me some love! Yeah, it's nothin' like that."
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, maybe I should call. Give one of the new kids a chance to talk to the legend."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe-ron? Moron! It's you, you little puke... I am gonna tie a rope around your neck and hang--"
Moe Szyslak,"And I really wanna thank you all. You gave me a new lease on life, and I'm gonna take this opportunity to..."
Moe Szyslak,"What's the point?... same ol' stinkin' world... ah, this post-suicide afterglow gets shorter every time!"
Moe Szyslak,"Four guys, a chick and a noose. Just like the movies I like to watch."
Moe Szyslak,"A new suit? Oh, ho, ho! I'll be the best-dressed john in the whorehouse! But listen, are you guys sure you wanna spring for something that expensive?"
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry? Pal? Hey, that's common courtesy. The kind I've only seen in movies! This suit is amazing."
Moe Szyslak,This dump is too filthy for a man with a positive worldview. I'm gonna start cleaning!
Moe Szyslak,Dirt... carpet... another layer of dirt... Congoleum... hardwood?! The perfect floor for doin' a happy jig!
Moe Szyslak,And now to light up the sign and let the world know that the new improved Moe is open for business.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I do have this bourbon that I brewed myself. It'll either be the best thing you ever had or the last thing you'll ever have."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, that is the most accurate picture of my face made of girl-parts that I have ever seen!"
Moe Szyslak,"Midge, the suit got a little mussed up. I gotta ask ya... is it noticeable?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierÃ³gi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, I get it. I get it. It wasn't the suit that made the bourbon -- it was me! And I can do anything!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I always go with three -- the number of brothers and sisters I, uh, ""Hunger Games'd"", in the womb."
Moe Szyslak,I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.
Moe Szyslak,"All our lottery money, gone! If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes, and scoop him into the urinal trough at the gathering of the Juggalos."
Moe Szyslak,"I had plans for that money too -- I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce! Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas, bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it..."
Moe Szyslak,"Well it don't matter no more, Midge. Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, get that outta here! I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot-thief again!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is! And that's where we're going! We gotta pack!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Lenny, when are you gonna wise up? Carl never wants to see us again! I'm done talkin' to you!"
Moe Szyslak,"Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our, friend... he's, uh, about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know that really makes you look like you know what you're doing. You peel it off, and you got that super-straight line there."
Moe Szyslak,"If we can forgive Carl for stealing our lottery winnings, maybe youse can find it in youse's hearts to forgive his ancestors."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I'd tell you guys I love you, but, uh, I don't wanna say it, and you don't wanna hear it..."
Moe Szyslak,Yeah. I sell 'em on the internet for like-minded people. Now let's lay some track.
Moe Szyslak,Go grab all his money and vodka and gin. And I'll knit a nice thnord from his leathery skin.
Moe Szyslak,Hey torso! What's with the cookies? Even the human snail would've been done by now!
Moe Szyslak,I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl. He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.
Moe Szyslak,My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
Moe Szyslak,"God, you are so beautiful in that peignoir there. I uh, better freshen up a little bit."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well at least ya got your health, huh? Now let's see if I can take that away from ya."
Moe Szyslak,I say we welcome our winter tourists with open arms -- then gouge the hell out of 'em! Who? Who will gouge with me?
Moe Szyslak,"What? That's crazy! Come on, you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower!"
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh. Well, well, well. Looks like youse and me may be up here for a while, eh? Yeah."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley. And me? I'm just a reliable source. Not ""sauce,"" ""source""! Source! ""S-A-U-R-C-E""!"
Moe Szyslak,"Midge, uh, condolences on your bereavement there. If, uh y'know, after a respectful period of grief and whatnot, uh, yous would like to have some coffee... please give a call. Yeah."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh heya Midge, uh, here we are again, huh? And, uh, here. My new card."
Moe Szyslak,You know what? No! I'm tired of getting my hopes up here. You and your immortal husband can go take a flying leap. Eh?!
Moe Szyslak,We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down. Mom and Pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.
Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Cap. Now what I'm proposing is a superhero pub crawl. Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar. Their masks make 'em feel uninhibited, and invulnerable."
Moe Szyslak,Take 'em! Take 'em! Fill their pockets with corn and toss 'em to the pigs.
Moe Szyslak,Yeah. It was really hard for me to make this place look old but not in any way comfortable. Now maybe some TV'll cheer ya up.
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, listen there, Midge. I know how to get youse outta your contract. But I gotta warn ya..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going."
Moe Szyslak,How many times I gotta tell you not to throw your trash in my dumpster?
Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no, it's my fault. I'm a hot head. I ain't got no beef with you, Toot."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, last year I broke it just so the repairman would come. But I'll be fine."
Moe Szyslak,She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.
Moe Szyslak,I'm happy on Christmas Eve. And for once it's not 'cause some drunk left a wallet on his stool.
Moe Szyslak,"And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time."
Moe Szyslak,"Howya doin' there? Uh, your front door was locked, so, uh, rather than call or knock, I, uh, came down the chimbley there."
Moe Szyslak,"Midge, it's one minute till Christmas and if I'm ever gonna be a good guy, it's now. Now here I go."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm the one that kept Homer from comin' home... 'cause... uh, well, I was lonely."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's right. Me, Mr. Party Pants. So, uh... so don't hold it against Homer, eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, Marge, I'm sorry, but it was Christmas and we were under the mistletoe..."
Moe Szyslak,I was in Tuscaloosa on vacation. It started out great. They got a jernt there called Moe's Original Barbecue.
Moe Szyslak,We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us! When every city in America has had its lips on it! Even Des Moines...
Moe Szyslak,"You know, as long as we're opening this up and I'm glad you are, I wanna tell you guys that when you call me a gargoyle, a troll, or a homunculus, it kinda hurts my feelin's."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, the first pour of the day. Let me just tie on my apron, limber up the ol' tap-pullin' arm..."
Moe Szyslak,"...So Sideshow Mel is drinkin' here all afternoon. When I show him the tab, he says he left his wallet in his other skirt, and he pays me with this!"
Moe Szyslak,I can't close down the bar on a Saturday. That's when you guys can drink 'cause you're not workin' for three days.
Moe Szyslak,"Huh... well, okay. Uh, let me just show you where everything is... shotgun, shotgun shells, blood mop, bag of lime -- and that's it. Now boys, I gotta get dressed for the, uh, ""theatah""!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I-I'm sorry for snappin' at you guys. But, but I'm ruint. I-I'll have to live on my savings here."
Moe Szyslak,"How come on your badge you got a mustache, but now you're not wearin' one, eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I sure appreciate this, fellas. What you guys did to me, then for me, I'll never forget slash forgive. So, thanks a lot. Also thanks a lot."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your musical career and everything, but, uh, we got no way of knowing that this is you."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, if you own a bar, you either keep it clean or learn to deal with inspectors. And Moe don't clean."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, let me be honest with yous. After all the money this plant lost on that nitwit Elon Musk, they're lookin' for cutbacks. So I've been goin' over your record."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg."
Moe Szyslak,"Well as supervisor, I can't fraternize with the... uh... what's the word... scum. Anyway, because I am your friend, you are safe. But you're gonna be reassigned."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey guys, you mind if I join you? They ran out of Beaujolais Cru in the executive dining room and I ain't drinkin' white with my coq au freakin' vin!"
Moe Szyslak,"You know, I think you're right there, Midge. I'm gonna build my bar back up better than ever. How hard can it be, eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, I think it might be time to hang up the ol' beaded seat cover there."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I figured out that the best way for me to get along with most people is to be kept behind a two foot chunk of solid oak."
Moe Szyslak,Really? Tell me something: I've heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.
Moe Szyslak,"Wow, Africa. I had a good friend who really wanted to go there. So, uh, you speak English there?"
Moe Szyslak,"That's pretty good there, but don't expect me to bow and scrape. Well, I'll give you one scrape."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I did. I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar."
Moe Szyslak,"If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!"
Moe Szyslak,"And she trashed my bar! Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her."
Moe Szyslak,This is terrible. Can't think of anything to mumble to myself. That's how upset I am here.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce ""joint."" I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?"
Moe Szyslak,"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
Moe Szyslak,"So, uh, what's a Princesses like you do all day, eh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treatin' you like crap?"
Moe Szyslak,Don't eat those eggs! We don't know what kinda bird they turn into! But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back. Help yourself.
Moe Szyslak,Goodnight eggs. Goodnight dregs. Goodnight bugs crawlin' up my legs. Goodnight beer. Goodnight mice. Goodnight Princess who treats me nice. Yeah.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, well, look who's up. Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar: call you a cab."
Moe Szyslak,Do you mind ridin' on a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?
Moe Szyslak,And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put coins in it. Whatever you like.
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, well, that's what I do. Sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this."
Moe Szyslak,"I'll field that. Yesterday, a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect."
Moe Szyslak,"Really not cheerin' me up here, but uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar. Sure works for me though."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar."
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lumpa coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long."
Moe Szyslak,"Wait a minute. Listen, to me you lousy bum! When I get a hold of you you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half!"
Moe Szyslak,I don't think you're ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? Bloodiest fight of the year, and you're sittin' there like a thirsty bump on a log."
Moe Szyslak,"What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, come on, come on everybody. We've got to get on with our lives. Let's try and put this tragedy behind us."
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? Hottest Ladies Night in months and you're not even checking out the action."
Moe Szyslak,"Wait a minute... Listen, you little yellow-belly rat jackass, if I ever find out who you are, I'll kill ya!"
Moe Szyslak,"Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you're outta here."
Moe Szyslak,"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen, you lousy bum, if I ever get hold of you, I swear, I'll cut your belly open!"
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!"
Moe Szyslak,"Just a sec. Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymour Butts!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, wait a minute. Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew."
Moe Szyslak,"Just a minute, let me check. Homer Sexual. Come on, come on. One of you guys must be Homer Sexual!"
Moe Szyslak,"Why you rotten little punk! If I ever get a hold of you, I'll sink my teeth into your cheek and rip your face off!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, sorry Principal Skinner. It must be a bad connection. It's for you. I think Bart's in trouble again."
Moe Szyslak,"Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell."
