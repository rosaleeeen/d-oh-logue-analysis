Moe Szyslak,"Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned."
Moe Szyslak,"I didn't mean to. At first, I was only gay for your money. And, and I had real, deep feelings for that money. But then I felt accepted by you in a way that I'd never been before. I just wish you people could know what it's like to want acceptance. Well, so who you gonna vote for? Me? Or a republican whose record is so anti-gay, he's clearly secretly super gay."
Moe Szyslak,"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
Moe Szyslak,"No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think."
Moe Szyslak,"Lemme check. Phone call for Al, Al Caholic. / Uh, Jacques Strap! / Is I Pee Freely here? / Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Uh, Homer Sexual / My Crotch / A Amanda Huggenkiss? / A Huge Ass / ""Ivanna Tinkle"" / I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
Moe Szyslak,TWENTY-SEVEN EELERS EELING / TWENTY-SIX ANARCHISTS BOMBING / TWENTY-FIVE SWAMIS FORESEEING / TWENTY-FOUR SIDEBURNS CURLING / TWENTY-THREE MONKS A-CHANTING / TWENTY-TWO RATS A-PLAGUING / TWENTY-ONE COXSWAINS CALLING / TWENTY FLAUTISTS FLUTING / NINETEEN FOOTMEN BOWING / EIGHTEEN GUNGAS DINNING / SEVENTEEN SEVENTY-SI-IX / SIXTEEN MIDWIVES BIRTHING / FIFTEEN ALIENISTS ALIENING / FOURTEEN JACKS A-RIPPING / THIRTEEN SCRIVENERS SCRIVNING / TWELVE LORDS A-LEAP--
Moe Szyslak,"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, so you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, hey 'Pu. I just want you to know that I got one of your kids here. This ain't a kidnapping thing, but if you're in the mood to give me a million dollars, that's cool. This should not be interpreted by federal agents as a threat. Once again, no threat, but will take the dough."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm gettin' a little emotional here, because your voice, it opened up a little part of me that I thought was closed to truth and beauty forever. If there's a God, I just hope that right now he's votin' your name on that 8-8-8 line. It was, it was really beautiful. Really. Thank you."
Moe Szyslak,"Um, ah, oh, g... I might as well come clean with ya. I ain't too good at talking to women, and... and I really wanted to do ya, so I brought along the love tester to help me. As you may have guessed, it's inhabited by the ghost of my friend's dead father."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, funny thing, that. You said the end was comin', so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen and gave the money to charity. Now them orphans got new skip ropes, and I end every day smelling like eel. Cats are all over me. Thank you, though. You did me a solid."
Moe Szyslak,"It's a letter from Homer. On my stationery. In my handwriting. Using my idioms and speech patterns. And it begins, ""Dear Midge: you probably hate me by now, and if you don't, what's wrong which youse? But don't give up on men. Bart, Linda and the other one there need a Dad."""
Moe Szyslak,And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
Moe Szyslak,"I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula."
Moe Szyslak,"I need a brilliant new poem for the farewell dinner. So if you could turn these into one of those and then don't say nothin' while I take all the credit, I'd really appreciate it, though I'd never admit that. And look, I got you started. Eh? Eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell."
Moe Szyslak,"Here's how you turn this place around. I let people do things in my bar they can't do nowhere else. You wanna drink on a Sunday morning? No problem. You wanna slow-dance with a goat? I'll be doin' a lot of things, but judgin' ain't one of 'em."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I guess that wraps it up. Hey, there's one thing I don't get, though. When my face was crushed, why did it go back to my old face? I mean, shouldn't it have turned into some kind of third face that was different? Heh. Don't make no..."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment."
Moe Szyslak,"I had to get Edna out of Springfield -- make a fresh start in a new town, far away. A place where we can play bridge with our neighbors. And if they're interested in wife-swapping, who am I to say no? I'm just the new guy."
Moe Szyslak,"Birthdays never meant squat to me. Then you offered to take me fishing, and like a stumblebum chump, I dared to hope. But you shattered my dreams like a Duff tallboy in a bar brawl. And you jammed the jagged neck right up my heart's butt."
Moe Szyslak,"Shut up, or I'll ram a stool down your throat! Ah, nah, nah, no, I don't want that on the card... Well, lemme hear how it sounds... Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out. And charge it to my Players Club card... Maxed out?"
Moe Szyslak,"Marge, sorry to call you so late but I had a great idea: put cutesy signs outside the restrooms that say ""dukes"" and ""dames"" instead of the ones we have now that say ""standups"" and ""sitdowns."" Huh? Tell me honestly, what do you think?"
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters..."
Moe Szyslak,"Now that's ""Moe"" like it. So bring the whole family - mom, dad, kids. Uh, no old people. They're not covered by our insurance. It's fun! And remember our guarantee: If I'm not smiling when your check comes, your meal's on me, Uncle Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were..."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, I need you to get the rats outta the jukebox, and clean the vomit out of the pool table pockets, and then you've got the job. Oh, and you've gotta share your tips with Manuel, who's actually me with a fake moustache."
Moe Szyslak,"Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in."
Moe Szyslak,"Name's Moe Szyslak. As a kid, I had roundworm. Heck, I was more worm than boy for a couple of years. I dabbled in Satanism, until I was asked to leave. Oh, uh, and one month I ate nothing but aquarium fish."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, now wait just a minute. One thing Moe Szyslak has never had is a partner. Nor a wife, a friend, a chum, a casual acquaintance, a pen pal, a parrot, a meaningful conversation, a brief hug or eye contact."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."
Moe Szyslak,"Maya... there's something I wanna ask ya, um... I don't know why I'm so nervous... this makes more sense than anything I've ever done... well, other than keepin' all my Netflix movies and sayin' the post office lost 'em. Anyway..."
Moe Szyslak,"Suicide. Finally. I'm really doin' it. No more cries for helllp! 'Cause this time there's no one that's gonna save me! I mean, it's not like I'm beggin' ya, please, please show me some love! Yeah, it's nothin' like that."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, excuse me, fellas. Excuse me. First of all... thank you. This bar was on its last legs. I was gonna have to move in with ma, who's dead and doesn't have a house. So, would not have been good."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, if we get bored on the bus, I got a book of brain teasers here. Let's see... oh, ""Brothers and sisters have I none, but this man's father is my father's son."" Huh. Screw you, you stupid thing!"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
Moe Szyslak,"Groundskeeper Willie, you know the guy in the skirt? He bought himself a mail-order bride, but he was too cheap to pay the C.O.D., right? So she's still in a crate down at the post office! Wanna go look-see?"
Moe Szyslak,"Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham? All right, I'll order. Um, I'll have a medium pepperoni. And can you space out the meat so it spells ""happy birthday Moe""? Oh, God I'm alone."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's enough there, 'Pu. Look, Ned, I know we ain't hung out much, what with your insane fear of drinking and me being banned from the church and all, but ah... but that Maude, she was really something."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know that really makes you look like you know what you're doing. You peel it off, and you got that super-straight line there."
Moe Szyslak,"And we can drink champagne out of an acorn top. Our first dance will be on the head of a pin! I've been hoggin' all the good ones. All right, now you go. But hey, keep it short!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, hey, I gotta gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching. And I... the feeling is indescribable."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children. It cuts through me like a dentist's drill. But no, no, that was funny, that was funny, takin' away my dignity like that. Ha ha ha."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... uh, I ain't got nothin' clean to compare it to."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that. I've been readin' that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give 'em what-for in the bedroom there."
Moe Szyslak,"Don Bardzini gets whacked. Tessio, Ohh... you won't see him no more. Moe Greene: Bam! He gets it right in the eye. And Michael is now the new Godfather. And he shuts the door on Annie Hall."
Moe Szyslak,People like Flanders make me sick. If I was Marge's landlord I'd fix her pipes and I'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the South Seas and I... I'd never return.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I have no idea what you do or who you work with, but I am sure if you put your foot down on their throats and grind until you hear a crunch, they'll sit up straight."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'."
Moe Szyslak,"Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy."
Moe Szyslak,"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."
Moe Szyslak,"So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now."
Moe Szyslak,"I had plans for that money too -- I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce! Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas, bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it..."
Moe Szyslak,"I'll field that. Yesterday, a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I, I knew it was something stupid. Well thanks, everybody. I... I'm always gonna remember today as the day that I learned to open my heart to human beings and not old pieces of cloth."
Moe Szyslak,"Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. Sears catalog."
Moe Szyslak,"You know, as long as we're opening this up and I'm glad you are, I wanna tell you guys that when you call me a gargoyle, a troll, or a homunculus, it kinda hurts my feelin's."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I'm just the bartender here, but it seems to me you could win Lisa back by appealing to her sense of reason. And you could win your Mom back by appealing to her feelings."
Moe Szyslak,"I sure am looking forward to my birthday fishing trip... Well I'll see ya soon, this is Moe, big day... uh, waitin', feeling uh, kind of fragile... Moe, the birthday boy, listenin' for your car..."
Moe Szyslak,"...I didn't rip out his voice box, but I did stretch out his tee shirt, then they said I ain't allowed back in California no more and I can no longer make judgments about nothin'..."
Moe Szyslak,"What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood."
Moe Szyslak,"And how are the little kids doin'? I mean really how are they doin'. Any disabling injuries? Something, say, that the gambling community might not yet know about? Come here, let me see those knees."
Moe Szyslak,"Telegram for Heywood U. Cuddlemee. Heywood U. Cuddlemee? Big guy in the back, Heywood U. Cuddlemee? He-- Ooh, that little... Ooh! I'm gonna drive a golden spike where your union meets your central pacific. Stop."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, well look who showed his face. The louse who sold out his only friend. You've got a lot of nerve comin' here... but since you did, what'll it be? First one's on the house."
Moe Szyslak,"All our lottery money, gone! If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes, and scoop him into the urinal trough at the gathering of the Juggalos."
Moe Szyslak,"Me? Well, I, uh, for a living? Well, there's all kinds of things a fella can do, such as... hemming, and hawing, and uh, but me, I'm a highly respected uh... therapist for alcoholics."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that's great. Thank you, thanks a lot. Ah, I just wanna say that it was an honor for me to compete with the Mick and the uh, the chick with the rack, there."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, you can't throw us out. I just made a Cornish game hen with chestnut stuffing. Would you believe a pigeon stuffed with Spam? Would you believe a rat filled with cough drops?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, lessee now... uh, time was, you'd send a boy off to war. Shootin' a man'd fix him right up. But there's not even any wars no more thank you very much Warren Christopher!"
Moe Szyslak,"I don't get this. This guy paints his noggin and you guys are ready to buy pants. Meanwhile, I been payin' for that billboard outside for a year now, and it's not yieldin' nothin'!"
Moe Szyslak,"""Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said: 'now if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole'."" I can't be the only one who likes this."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's true. That's true, baby. Hmf, it'll be hell being locked away from ya, but I guess I gotta take my medicine. Unless... Unless, I send a letter to the police clearing Homer..."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, now this first thing is just gonna look like a used Band Aid. And it is. But the rest of this stuff won't make no sense without it. So uh, bear with me."
Moe Szyslak,"Take her down to the diner at the department store there. Get her a roast beef on rye. Oh, and make sure she gets a fruit cup on the side -- she's worth it."
Moe Szyslak,"Huh... well, okay. Uh, let me just show you where everything is... shotgun, shotgun shells, blood mop, bag of lime -- and that's it. Now boys, I gotta get dressed for the, uh, ""theatah""!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and uh, you all try to guess what it is."
Moe Szyslak,"Lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in Vermont. Except for those two dudes I saw gettin' hitched. Not my thing, but I wish 'em well."
Moe Szyslak,Huh. Hey maybe this is a sign. Maybe it's time for me to get out of the alcohol business. Give barber college another try -- and this time I won't join a frat.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce ""joint."" I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no, no baby. No, no... Okay, Part Two. Little Anthony's having his first communion at Lake Tahoe. Meanwhile Michael can't get a gaming license. But Senator Geary's got one weakness: call girls..."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe's Tavern. Hold on, I'll check. ... Hey everybody! I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
Moe Szyslak,"I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow and these uhhh... seven presents I brung. Eh, you know what? Cram some shrimp in, too. Head to tail. That way you can fit more."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!"
Moe Szyslak,Perhaps I should've told you in person. But there's no easy way to say goodbye forever. So I'll say it the hardest way I can: in Mandarin Chinese. Zai jian yong yuan!
Moe Szyslak,"""Dear friends, I have some news that is doubly sad -- first off, I am leaving town forever. And my going away present? One of your wives is running off with me."""
Moe Szyslak,"You ever scrub your hands real fast, and think you're seein' a third one? One time I looked down and there really was. I gotta get a new lock for that bathroom."
Moe Szyslak,"Righ-- No, no. Wrong. Listen. While I'm on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. Then when the 10:15 train comes along..."
Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Cap. Now what I'm proposing is a superhero pub crawl. Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar. Their masks make 'em feel uninhibited, and invulnerable."
Moe Szyslak,"Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, Midge. You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy. But what can we do about it now? It's not like we can play the game over again."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, remember, Midge. You feel the need to rage, you call me, right? I won't even get sexual or nothin'. Unless that's what you want. That, that's not what you want, right?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, what are you laughin' at? What? Oh, oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well children, I can't help that!"
Moe Szyslak,"Midge, uh, condolences on your bereavement there. If, uh y'know, after a respectful period of grief and whatnot, uh, yous would like to have some coffee... please give a call. Yeah."
Moe Szyslak,"Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending. I, when I first saw the movie Ironweed, I thought, ya know ""this is for me."" But now, well, I'm not so sure."
Moe Szyslak,"But some flowers can stab you in the back. / For which I should send you flowers. / Which I will, but they were closed. / You'll be gettin' them tomorrow."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: ""Pontiff No Return"". I came up with it, but I don't really get it."
Moe Szyslak,"I got just the drink to wipe your mind clean... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."" Fellas, if you got anything that you want to say to Homer that he'll never remember, say it now."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, I told you not to come 'round here no more till you paid your tab. Or at least cleaned up that mess you made in the bathroom. Now y--"
Moe Szyslak,"All right, let me be honest with yous. After all the money this plant lost on that nitwit Elon Musk, they're lookin' for cutbacks. So I've been goin' over your record."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm just excited because they're showin' an episode of ""Boy Meets World"" on this flight. Oh no, wait. That's only on flights from Europe. We just get that little plane."
Moe Szyslak,"You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll?"
Moe Szyslak,"I'm payin' extra for this channel? Hasn't been good since ""The Wire."" Aw, who am I kiddin'? I never watched ""The Wire."" Had to bluff my way through so many conversations."
Moe Szyslak,"Good God. Homer, y'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit."
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn't have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, ya remember that time I tried to hang myself and the rope broke? Well, I sued the rope company and got a huge settlement... and a new rope!"
Moe Szyslak,"And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, time to chase this pig into the sty. Uh Marge, you deserve a man who listens to you. Who respects you. Who understands what a treasure you really are."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
Moe Szyslak,"You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking ""attractive"" and ""desirable"". It's just so rare and refreshing."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?"
Moe Szyslak,"But, can you blame me? Every day it's the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin' tip."
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself Oh boy, I'm gonna start bawling, here."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey guys, you mind if I join you? They ran out of Beaujolais Cru in the executive dining room and I ain't drinkin' white with my coq au freakin' vin!"
Moe Szyslak,"Boy, I love Valentine's Day. Stir a drop of JÃ¤germeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it ""Cupid's Ambrosia,"" and you can charge up the wazoo."
Moe Szyslak,"How can you judge this man, without talking to the people who know him best. We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the biddin' starts at ten G's."
Moe Szyslak,"Come to papa... Wait a minute! You have a straight flush, Homer. Go! You do this every time. You... oh, you, ah, ... I'm choking on my own rage here."
Moe Szyslak,"...So Sideshow Mel is drinkin' here all afternoon. When I show him the tab, he says he left his wallet in his other skirt, and he pays me with this!"
Moe Szyslak,"Total disaster. Complete bomb. Utter failure. Uh, dream I painted. And in this economy a man needs to find new customers while keeping his old best friends. So, whaddaya say?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, oh, Grizzly Shawn, that's so nice of you to think of me. But... uh... the Tony Awards are that night and I'll be too keyed up to have fun."
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him from bowling with us tonight. Heh, heh, heh..."
Moe Szyslak,"So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized."
Moe Szyslak,MOE MOE MOE / HOW DO YOU LIKE ME? / HOW DO YOU LIKE ME? / MOE MOE MOE / WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME? / NOBODY LIKES ME...
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway."
Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait, wait, don't un-form! You're a great mob -- we'll think of something else to get upset about! How 'bout all that construction on Route One? Huh? Huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, it don't hurt no more. Heh. Now I can focus on my crippling emotional pain. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why? Why won't you hug me? You hug the mailman."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
Moe Szyslak,"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
Moe Szyslak,Whaddaya been sippin' cuckoo juice? Homer's got it made. He's married to one hell of a woman. All I've got is this porn channel I'm too cheap to de-scramble.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeahhh, well, I just get so tired of idiots shootin' their mouths off, laughin' and clappin'. Makes you wanna start pokin' eyes out and slashin' guts and kickin' throats..."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question. We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in, ah... you know, one of them loser countries."
Moe Szyslak,...my soul smells like a dead pigeon after three weeks. / I shut my window and go to sleep. / In my dream I eat corn with my eyes.
Moe Szyslak,"That is the stupidest story I ever heard, and I've read the entire Sweet Valley High series. Ha. I am sick of you drunks and your shaggy dog stories."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses."
Moe Szyslak,Don't eat those eggs! We don't know what kinda bird they turn into! But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back. Help yourself.
Moe Szyslak,"Everyone relax, huh -- I know the Heimlich. I learned it a few years ago. It was nineteen ninety-seven, and ""Titanic"" was proving unsinkable at the box office..."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips..."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierÃ³gi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me."
Moe Szyslak,"Doreen? She's cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I've showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya..."
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!"
Moe Szyslak,... So like a coward I let Homer take the rap for the whole scam. And now the only way to clear him is to turn myself in.
Moe Szyslak,"Look at me. It's supposed to be my big triumph and I'm standing in mud, fightin' with geese. Well, if I'm gonna fight, I might as well win."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I figured out that the best way for me to get along with most people is to be kept behind a two foot chunk of solid oak."
Moe Szyslak,Ode to Lisa: Pointy-headed mini-muse. / More friend than I deserved. / You pulled me from the dirt / and made me the beautiful flower that I am.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I sure appreciate this, fellas. What you guys did to me, then for me, I'll never forget slash forgive. So, thanks a lot. Also thanks a lot."
Moe Szyslak,"What? What? A bartender can't come by and say ""hi"" to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer... this bar's only for real Americans. And people on permanent visas, like me. What? What are you all lookin' at? I'm Dutch. Eh, forget all of you."
Moe Szyslak,"Before you do, I just gotta warn you, Marge. MY TASTE FOR ROMANCE IS KINDA PERVERSE / I CAN ONLY MAKE LOVE IN THE BACK OF A HEARSE..."
Moe Szyslak,"Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language."
Moe Szyslak,"Ha. Ha. Cute kid. But, just in case you don't kill Hamlet, I put some poison on the food, on the drapes, even on Rosen-Carl and Guilden-Lenny here."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?"
Moe Szyslak,"It's too late -- I don't got the cash to clean up the bar. From now on, you guys are gonna hafta do your drinking across the street."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! I'm not the villain here, okay? If Homer gets killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative attitude! There, I said it."
Moe Szyslak,"There ya go! That's the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! Y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I was wonderin' if you could help save my soul. I've done stuff I ain't proud of. And the stuff I am proud of is disgusting."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey! Sabu! Ah, I need another magnum of your best champagne, here, uh? And bring us the finest food you got, stuffed with the second finest."
Moe Szyslak,"Really? Hot damn! All right. Don't eat nothin' for the next three days, 'cause I'm takin' you out for a steak the size of a toilet seat!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
Moe Szyslak,"A new suit? Oh, ho, ho! I'll be the best-dressed john in the whorehouse! But listen, are you guys sure you wanna spring for something that expensive?"
Moe Szyslak,But it's brought you everything a man could want -- I bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing 'em till the food drops through.
Moe Szyslak,"Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer's heart that he's been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... God bless ya."
Moe Szyslak,"Well as supervisor, I can't fraternize with the... uh... what's the word... scum. Anyway, because I am your friend, you are safe. But you're gonna be reassigned."
Moe Szyslak,"I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!"
Moe Szyslak,"Cleo, Cleo, you've brought music to my heart, but this relationship can never work. I'm a doctor, and you're a 5,000-year-old mummy I brought back to life."
Moe Szyslak,We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down. Mom and Pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.
Moe Szyslak,"No, I thought that we had a connection here, and we're out in the woods and everything, and... hey, forget it. I ain't gonna beg for it."
Moe Szyslak,"PLUS I GOTTA BE DRESSED AS A CIVIL WAR NURSE / AND THEN WHEN I'M FINISHED, I'LL GO THROUGH YOUR PURSE / BUT YOU COULD DO WORSE..."
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley. And me? I'm just a reliable source. Not ""sauce,"" ""source""! Source! ""S-A-U-R-C-E""!"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, your ""teef"" hurt, huh? Your ""teef"" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! You hear me? I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' ""sodie, too!"""
Moe Szyslak,"Get ya hands off me. Get off! I don't need your stinkin' show, anyway. With a mug like this, I can get on any soap in Springfield."
Moe Szyslak,"Wait a minute. Listen, to me you lousy bum! When I get a hold of you you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin."
Moe Szyslak,"Can't your old buddy Moe stop by with a list of questions from the Weekly World News? Number one: Sara, is it true you shoplifted a kayak?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hot damn, I won! Marge, I swear I'll be the best man you ever had. It's gonna be all flowers and back rubs and how-was-your-day dear and--"
Moe Szyslak,"SITTIN' IN A ROCKING CHAIR / EATING BABY CRACK-ERS / TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, TIC TOCK, BANANA / A-B-C-D-E-F-G / WASH THOSE JUNE BUGS OFF OF ME"
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, did you hear that? She called me handsome. Me. It's like I've gone to heaven... Wait a minute. I died on the operating table, didn't I?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, don't you try and prank me with a fake name -- I'll rip out your intestines and use 'em to make a lanyard... Hello? Hello?"
Moe Szyslak,"If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--"
Moe Szyslak,Yeah. It was really hard for me to make this place look old but not in any way comfortable. Now maybe some TV'll cheer ya up.
Moe Szyslak,This says I ain't allergic to pollen. So I could'a gone to the park and played with other kids. I gotta make up for lost time!
Moe Szyslak,"Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance."
Moe Szyslak,It's a timeless tale of the... hello! Are you seein' what I'm seein' here? Ooh! This omniscient point of view has got some surprising bonuses! Yeah.
Moe Szyslak,"Well... uh... well, I just made friends with Pepto-Bismol on Facebook and uh... um... Hey, would ya look at that? There's a spot on the bar!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it."
Moe Szyslak,You are clearly too smart to be down here with these dingle-bells. I'm promotin' you to Toy Inspector. The rest of youse are laid off. Scram.
Moe Szyslak,"So all you mugs out there, be sure you don't take for granted the woman you love. Oh, and it's Mother's Day, so call your ma."
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
Moe Szyslak,"Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down."
Moe Szyslak,"Just relax there, Waylon. We got a great thing goin' on. Now we can afford real bowls of pretzels instead of trompe-l'oeil-ing 'em on the bar."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how Lisa is, ah,... how do I put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 per cent of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys."
Moe Szyslak,"You little S.O.B., if I ever find out who you are I'm gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt!"
Moe Szyslak,"Was you ever. You came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."""
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, there she is, the birthday girl. Oh, your mommy tied a bow for you, huh. I'd better retie it -- the way you like it."
Moe Szyslak,I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I do have this bourbon that I brewed myself. It'll either be the best thing you ever had or the last thing you'll ever have."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah y'know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular. But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction."
Moe Szyslak,"Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas."
Moe Szyslak,"Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!"
Moe Szyslak,She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.
Moe Szyslak,"Oooh, boy. All right, let's see here, uh... Well I was born in Indiana... so that ain't it. And, uh... I better call my Lifeline."
Moe Szyslak,"Why you rotten little punk! If I ever get a hold of you, I'll sink my teeth into your cheek and rip your face off!"
Moe Szyslak,"What? You mean that time he wigged out? Well, uh, gimme some of that Indian memory tea, there and I'll tell you all about it."
Moe Szyslak,"It all goes back to my acting days. I was auditioning for the role of Dr. Tad Winslow on the hit soap, ""It Never Ends."""
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, wait a minute. Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew."
Moe Szyslak,"I dunno if I want you in here no more, Homer, uh... I got a lotta secrets I'd prefer to keep clandestine. Terrible, disturbing secrets."
Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. How can you arrest Homer? This guy's the one what done the thing that why you're here for. I'm talkin' malfeasance here.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no problem. You know, it-it gave me kind of a good warm feelin'. Like when you get drunk and fall asleep in the snow."
Moe Szyslak,We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us! When every city in America has had its lips on it! Even Des Moines...
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, I've been meanin' to get that updated, uh, for this state, and real. Now let's see the poster boy for the new Moe-lennium."
Moe Szyslak,It's just as well. There's no such thing as a Birditarod. It was just a trick to scam you out of your house. Good day.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons ."
Moe Szyslak,MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ DRINK IT DOWN/ YA STUPID CLOWN/ MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ THEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS... WHOA!
Moe Szyslak,"Well... no... no... well... no... not a... lot... I... Gee, I'm sorry. I used to box you know, my brain's... Well, it's in and out."
Moe Szyslak,"If you like good food, good fun, and a whole lotta crazy crap on the walls, then come on down to ""Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag."""
Moe Szyslak,"Might as well face it, I'll never find anyone. Come on tide -- take me with ya. I just don't wanna feel no more pain."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire."
Moe Szyslak,"Hi. How you folks doin'? I'm Moe. Or as the ladies like to call me, ""Hey you, behind the bushes."" Uh, is this thing on?"
Moe Szyslak,"Look, I'd love to discuss your problems but a pack of raccoons took over my back room and today's the day I make my stand."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, here's how you get back at Flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, come on folks! Wait! Please, come back! Please! I got a new offer! Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak... fish."
Moe Szyslak,"I would do anything to chat with Maya, short of actually purchasing a computer. We decided to take the next big step -- exchanging photos..."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! There's a white wine? And wha- a Swiss cheese? And a peanut butter? And a potato chip? And toilet paper? Wha-what?!"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely off the truck."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, okay, uh... prepare to be kissed... here we go... giving in to my natural urges... okay, a few jumping jacks just to warm up..."
Moe Szyslak,"Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh listen, Homer -- I know a guy who fixes things for folks who need things fixed. But, uh, I can't talk about it here."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich."
Moe Szyslak,"Wow, for the first time in my life, someone's taking a genuine interest in what's inside of me. Suddenly, this is my best birthday ever!"
Moe Szyslak,"And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
Moe Szyslak,That's the beauty part. Every cop in town's gonna be on the Police Department's Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I'm gonna be right there with 'em.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars..."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, you can't donate that gold to the museum today, 'cause um... uh it's closed, so they can clean under the wangs on the statues."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I gotta get home. There might be a telemarketer calling or something. I'll see you when you're old enough to drink, okay, Magpie."
Moe Szyslak,"Don't forget, Christmas is a wonderful time to take up alcoholism. You see your family all year round. The holidays are for your bartender."
Moe Szyslak,"When-I-get-a-hold-of-you... oh dammit, I typed an F, not a D. Uh... Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. Oh crap, I just donated twenty dollars to Haiti!"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, well, I really enjoyed being you, Dr. Hibbert. Uh, oh by the way, you're not welcome in the library no more. I'm sorry."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey there, well... it's my business partner, Mr. Smithers. Nice of you to drop by and not say nothin' that costs nobody no election."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I think if you guys can manage to go into the voting booth one at a time, then I can manage to win!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm so sorry, uh, but tonight I've got a long-overdue manscaping. But have fun! 'Cause you're the one that I want."
Moe Szyslak,Is the preacher here? 'Cause there's somethin' I gotta get offa my chest. Somethin' more suited for the town gossip than the minister's wife.
Moe Szyslak,This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah I guess you're right. It's just that I, you know, went to a lot of trouble, you know makin' the envelope and everything..."
Moe Szyslak,You know what? No! I'm tired of getting my hopes up here. You and your immortal husband can go take a flying leap. Eh?!
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, them gay guys got lots of disposable income. I can serve fancy drinks and charge ten bucks a pop. What's in a martini?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I put this up recently, and it's a good thing I did, 'cause it really illustrates my point. Yep, good ol' Swigmore U."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out!"
Moe Szyslak,I say we welcome our winter tourists with open arms -- then gouge the hell out of 'em! Who? Who will gouge with me?
Moe Szyslak,My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
Moe Szyslak,"Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you're outta here."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen booze-bags, I got a good thing goin' here. If you mess it up, I will ""out"" the one of you that is gay."
Moe Szyslak,"I dunno... the only book I ever read was ""Super Hounds: The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System"". So uh... any of you wetnaps write that?"
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, I get it. I get it. It wasn't the suit that made the bourbon -- it was me! And I can do anything!"
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I've gotta know which of the two true faiths you represent."
Moe Szyslak,"You know, I think you're right there, Midge. I'm gonna build my bar back up better than ever. How hard can it be, eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes..."
Moe Szyslak,"The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher."
Moe Szyslak,"I knew that in order to win her love, I needed to get rid of the human garbage otherwise known as my best friends."
Moe Szyslak,"Maggie's missing? You gotta let me help find her, please! We have a special bond. Even greater than her bond with the duck-shaped washcloth."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Mag. Raggedy Andy over there has been giving you the button-eye. I'll get rid of him. All right, come on. Out you go."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, well, look who's up. Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar: call you a cab."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide."
Moe Szyslak,"And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time."
Moe Szyslak,"I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one."
Moe Szyslak,"""You're funny. Very nice. Now, how can I put this? Um... ""Are you sure you're not actually some creepy guy in a public library?"""
Moe Szyslak,"White rabbit... chicks poppin' mushrooms... this is like the Playboy Mansion. Maybe I can think of a story uh, more suitable for a baby."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, now let's say I put a Lean Cuisine in a blender and I pour some beer on it. What do you call that?"
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, Homer! I'm one of your dearest friends! When everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?"
Moe Szyslak,Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili? I start with the best part -- the neck. And then I add secret hobo spices.
Moe Szyslak,"Wow. Anyway, you don't think he could be at another bar, do you? Because I couldn't take that! I... uh... I-I just couldn't! I..."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
Moe Szyslak,"What? I'm a monster, right? I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, periodically emerging to sue you."
Moe Szyslak,"Listen, I'm just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family and I'll give you a beer!"
Moe Szyslak,"That's good, no. Let it out. That's it. Let it out. Send me to Maude. That's it. Oh, here I come, baby. Oh, yeah."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. I think they had a thing going."
Moe Szyslak,Here ya go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank ya Ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am! While you eat!
Moe Szyslak,I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl. He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.
Moe Szyslak,"That's a terrific title! It jumps out at you like a rat in your underwear drawer. We make a great team there, Liser."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey! Aw, that's great. Now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car."
Moe Szyslak,"Whew! I thought it was an inventory issue. That's a big relief. Now don't worry, I'll let 'em down easy. In four years!"
Moe Szyslak,HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / I FEEL SO DAMN LONELY / WON'T SOMEONE KILL ME AND MANY MORE...
Moe Szyslak,"You owe me... 70 billion dollars. No, wait, wait, wait... Oh, that's uh, for the Voyager Space Craft. Your tab's 14 billion dollars."
