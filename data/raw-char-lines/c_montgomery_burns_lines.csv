C. Montgomery Burns,"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!"" Smithers, I'm back!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed."
C. Montgomery Burns,I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Senile,"" eh? ""Buck-toothed,"" am I? ""Bony arms,"" are they? ""Liver spots,"" did I? ""Chinless,"" will you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!"
C. Montgomery Burns,A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, ""Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?"" And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist."
C. Montgomery Burns,Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hm. ""Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He's distracting the female employees."" Smithers..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh! It's a real one! ""No more apples in the vending machine, please."" Well, that's almost a sentence!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She'll make everything all right, I promise."
C. Montgomery Burns,Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
C. Montgomery Burns,"The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"The boys at the Diners Club will think I've gone quite mad. Oh, and I'll have that roadster in the corner as well."
C. Montgomery Burns,Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction."
C. Montgomery Burns,"But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, Smithers, it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson's my man!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility."
C. Montgomery Burns,It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville.
C. Montgomery Burns,We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit."
C. Montgomery Burns,Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine tails."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... The human brain."
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I didn't. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damn it, Smithers. This isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, Smithers, a twitch... it's moving. It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who's mad now?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, let's not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A lovely promise, but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Snappy, do you it's hard to imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam homeruns and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl."
C. Montgomery Burns,You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant!
C. Montgomery Burns,So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, don't worry. I think you'll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that's just John and Frank!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I wanted to give you something to remember me by. I know you've always had your eye on this photo of Elvis and me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said. Misht Burnsh, dajna boo mafrn friszner... er hound-dog."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just a second, Smithers. Let me introduce you to the gang. That's Buzz. That's Honey. And you see that queen over there? Her name is ""Smithers."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my ""buddy"" here."
C. Montgomery Burns,What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back!
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head."
C. Montgomery Burns,And then one day... when he least expects it --
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless."
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub and the title is ours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! All right, find me some good players. Living players! Scour the professional ranks. The American League. The National League. The Negro Leagues."
C. Montgomery Burns,And now I'd like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family. Our new security guard... Roger Clemens...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Our new, well uh, we'll make up jobs for these fellows later... Please say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose Canseco."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play."
C. Montgomery Burns,One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!
C. Montgomery Burns,"As your new manager, I want to say this up front. No one is assured a spot in the starting line-up. I don't care if your name is Steve Sax, Darryl Strawberry, or... Smithers, what's one of the bad players' names?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a brain and nerve tonic. Rich in proteids and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. Of course, it has been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases. Try some."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Now, let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers -- the medicine balls."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I don't know. Throw it on the pile, I suppose."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Put a lid on it, Simpson. There's no ""I"" in ""team""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let's call it heart."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You, look what you've done! My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken! Make no mistake, I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, I guess it's not your fault... you did a good job."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"
C. Montgomery Burns,The man who plays your position is still here. Hit the pine.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Monty, it's up to you managerial skills. What to do. Smithers, massage my brain."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames."
C. Montgomery Burns,You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
C. Montgomery Burns,If I tug the bill of my cap like so...
C. Montgomery Burns,"However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly."
C. Montgomery Burns,"If I want you to bunt, I will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."""
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders."
C. Montgomery Burns,If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
C. Montgomery Burns,Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you're all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I'm rambling. Anybody want any coffee?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now to present the award, here's former heavyweight champion, Smokin' Joe Frazier."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors."
C. Montgomery Burns,"He's either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we're going ashore."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course. We wouldn't think of going without the bait... uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty -- The bathing beauty. I covered that up pretty well."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, he's saying, ""We wouldn't dream of sacrificing the blue-haired woman!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this is a golden opportunity. If we get him alive we can put him on Broadway. Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the Army!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, we don't want to kill him, shoot him around the groin and belly."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, you big ape, get a snootful of this gas bomb."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nice work, Smithers. When we get back, I'm giving you a raise."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, the ape's going to stand around for three hours or so. Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy of Douggan an Dershowitz."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ladies and gentlemen, in his native land he was a king. But he comes before you in chains, for your own amusement. Presenting Homer, the Eighth Wonder of the World!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I am dreading the reviews, I can tell you that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, but his career is. I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building. After that, he couldn't get arrested in this town."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, me, me, me ""I need all the attention just because it's my party, eh!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the departure of Mr. Marley, there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G. Now get out. The bar is closed."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That woman -- she's so captivating. Smithers, my heart's pounding like a jackhammer."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I must have her. Smithers, zoom in. Closer... Closer... closer, damn it!"
C. Montgomery Burns,No need for alarm. I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees.
C. Montgomery Burns,It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Marge, I'm giving you a raise and a new office... right next to mine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry Smithers, I'm putting you where the action is."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate. Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's right, he's dead. And rather pungent. The rest of that night is something I'd like to forget. All right, then. Bring me that crooner she likes so much... Tom Jones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I was wondering if you were free for a little get-together tonight. Dinner, dancing and ... Mr. Tom Jones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You... have a husband? Yes, I can picture him now... rugged good looks... sweater knotted about his shoulders... curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold..."
C. Montgomery Burns,You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head -- you're a mess, woman ."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at that pig stuffing his face with donuts on my time. That's right, keep eating. Little do you know you're drawing ever closer to the poisoned donut. There is a poisoned one isn't there, Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Relax, Simpson. I just brought you in here for a friendly, ""Hello."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"But wait, perhaps I'm being too hasty. You are highly skilled... at goofing off!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now don't worry, Homer. You're the kind of guy I could really dig. A grave for. Your indolence is inefficacious!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, all those bald children are arousing suspicion -- to the park!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and uh, I'll take that statue of Justice too."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello. My name is Mr. Snrub, and I come from... eh, someplace far away. Yes, that will do. Anyway, I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well let's look at the contract ourselves. Benefits... perks... a green cookie on St. Patrick's Day? Oh, it didn't used to be this way, Smithers. No, it didn't used to be this way at all..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"If only we had listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven. Well, I'm going to avenge my grandfather. We'll take on that greedy union and get back our..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons."
C. Montgomery Burns,This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see. ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?"" You stupid monkey!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30's."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oooo, look at him strutting around like he's cock of the walk. Well, let me tell you, Homer Simpson is cock of nothing. Why you and I can run this plant ourselves."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal"
C. Montgomery Burns,All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was."
C. Montgomery Burns,This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this plague doesn't scare me. I've constructed a germ-free chamber for myself. Not a single microbe can get in or out."
C. Montgomery Burns,Huh? What? How dare you disturb me during nap time!
C. Montgomery Burns,"There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy..."
C. Montgomery Burns,The watchdog of public safety. Is there any lower form of life?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe. Now you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Or you can trade it all in for what's in this box.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Is that so? Well I have the feeling you'll be ""dropping"" the charges..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Simpson. My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and thought we'd stop by."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and one more thing. You must find the jade monkey before the next full moon."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry, Simpson, it just so happens I have a chair at Springfield University..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, you know, fellas, I look at the admissions board a lot like a baseball team. You all like baseball, don't you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork. Not some hot dog admissions officer playing by his own rules."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, dismember the corpse and send his widow a corsage."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bobo! Bo-Bo! Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow."
C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show.
C. Montgomery Burns,"That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers. Who is he?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him."
C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I'll never leave you behind again.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes. Naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because... I'm strapped for cash."
C. Montgomery Burns,"As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry, Smithers, he's playing hard ball now. But it won't take him long to crack."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"As you can see, Simpson, I've taken over all seventy-eight channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in."
C. Montgomery Burns,What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer swilling tube jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang on to that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made."
C. Montgomery Burns,"For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened. I'm actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Bobo reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. Ah, yes. Wonder..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bobo I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm... Who's that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, come in. Ah, fresh victims for my ever-growing army of the undead."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ooh sounds delish. Let me just toss some jeans on and... Wait a minute! Who is this?!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I feel like such a free spirit. And I'm really enjoying this so-called ""iced cream."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why that's a fabulous idea. Anything else you'd like? How about real lead in the radiation shields? Urinal cakes maybe? Smithers, throw this at him."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, find someone cheap. It's been a very lean year for us."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent, Zutroy. Work hard and each day you'll get a shiny penny."
C. Montgomery Burns,That's preposterous. Zutroy here is as American as apple pie.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, I'll bring in a woman. But I still stand by my hiring policies."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at those two inseparable chums, Smithers. That's exactly the teamwork we'd like to showcase at this year's Energy Convention."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well no one else seems to share the same spirit of camaraderie.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you so much for visiting our plant, Dr. Kissinger."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hey, tough times, eh? I've lived through twelve recessions, eight panics, and five years of McKinley-nomics. I'll survive this!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh! Very well -- lay off... Him, him, him, him..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, better keep the egghead. He just might come in handy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"By building a casino, I could tighten my stranglehold on this dismal town!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I'll never forget my carefree boyhood days on this old boardwalk..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What was I laughing at, now? Oh yes, that crippled Irishman."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Idiots. I'll design it myself. I know what people like. It's got to have sex appeal, and a catchy name."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I've discovered the perfect business. People swarm in, empty their pockets, and scuttle off. Nothing can stop me now. Except microscopic germs. But we won't let that happen. Will we Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've designed a new plane. I call it the Spruce Moose, and it will carry two hundred passengers from New York's Idlewild Airport to the Belgian Congo in seventeen minutes."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! I don't want that unpredictable lunatic working in my casino!
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah! To hell with this! Get my razor! Draw a bath! And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, we'll hang on to those. Now, to the plant! We'll take the Spruce Moose. Hop in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters before the start of the rainy season. And remember, a shiny new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Huh? What? And by that I mean, of course, it's time for the Worker of the Week Award. I can't believe we've overlooked this week's winner for so very very long. We simply could not function without his tireless efforts. So, a round of applause for... this inanimate carbon rod."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in the hospital who wants you to win this game. I know because I crippled him myself to inspire you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It was I, you fools! The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You, Smithers? Oh no, my dear friend, I've planned a far greater reward for you. When I pass on, you shall be buried alive with me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate. And now, our feature presentation."
C. Montgomery Burns,"LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, GET OURSELVES SOME SNACKS...."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I like his energy. Put him on the call back list."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, he's the worst yet! That's it! Everyone out! Except you! One step to the left."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh look, a bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we'll see what the lab has to say about that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look Smithers, a creature of pure malevolence. He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was talking to him. You, what day is this?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll tell you what day it is. Today is the day you become my heir!
C. Montgomery Burns,Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of ""booger man,"" but I'm really not such a bad ""dude."" Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. It's made from hooves, you know."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is my pride and joy. I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield. I got the idea from that movie ""Sliver."" What a delightful romp!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, my plan worked perfectly. Bart Simpson will live here as my son, and I will mold him in my own graven image. Who knows, I may even grow to love him. Bartholomew!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bartholomew, you don't need him. I can be your schoolyard chum!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, pish posh. There's a jaws of life in the trunk."
C. Montgomery Burns,That was delightful! Did you see that? That mouse butchered that cat like a hog! Is all TV this wonderful?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this, but... I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"People, that was all wrong. Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh!"" he says... ""D'oh!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, just get it right or you'll all be back doing ""Come Blow your Horn"" at the Westport Dinner Theater!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right then, let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, that's to correct your posture. Soon you'll have a mighty hump."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, you really are my son. This calls for a celebration. Let's fire some employees."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you, without using the letter ""E,"" you can keep your job."
C. Montgomery Burns,Huh! What a coincidence. And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty. Go ahead Bartholomew. You may fire when ready.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hurry! Fire him now or I'll disown you. You'll lose everything. The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video, the freedom to do whatever you want."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? Fire me? That does it, you can never be my son..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who told y-- ?! Yesss. Well, I'd say you were an angel, but angels don't dance like that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"She said ""no"" to me. Do you know how many women have said ""no"" to me? One hundred thirty. But only one since I've become a billionaire. And she's the one for me. I'm in love!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whooop de-doo, Mr. Florist! Whoop de-doo, Mr. Physical Trainer! Whoop-de-doo, Mr. President!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoop-de-doo, employees! Everyone who's found true love may leave early today!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Memorandum to: Mrs. Bouvier. Re: Delineation of Romantic Intentions..."" Pfffft, too sappy. Smithers, come over here and help me write a mash note to my girlfriend!"
C. Montgomery Burns,That's marvelous. How did you think of that so fast?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, my dear, if you look in your champagne, I think you'll find a little surprise..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not to worry. I believe there's another one around here, somewhere."
C. Montgomery Burns,"My darling, since my kneecaps are filling with fluid as we speak, I'll be brief. Will you marry me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,We've heard enough about Blizblaz and Himham already! Get to the bloody point!
C. Montgomery Burns,"The ring, you little imbecile! Before I really lose my temper!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, then. Gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us and if we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby we need a candidate with name recognition and media savvy. A true leader who will do exactly as he's told."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh goody, the Sea Monkeys I ordered have arrived. Look at them cavort and caper."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those low-lifes."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm afraid it's not that simple. As punishment for your desertion, it's company policy to give you the plague."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah yes, the special demotivational plaque, to break what's left of your spirit. Because, you see, you're here forever."
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped thirty-seven percent.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But I like that film biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power, like ""Bugsy,"" or ""Working Girl."" Get me Steven Spielberg!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Listen, SeÃ±or Spielbergo. I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simple villagers, I promise you I will close plants in America and bring work here."
C. Montgomery Burns,We did twenty takes and that was the best one.
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care what they say. I'm going to win this festival.
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. Bribing those two judges has paid off. Just as it did during the Miss Teen America pageant.
C. Montgomery Burns,I've got to win this one. I've bribed everyone in Hollywood.
C. Montgomery Burns,"...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm? Oh, of course not. They're your pets, you can do as you wish. Good day, everyone."
C. Montgomery Burns,"There you are, there ya go li'l' fella, and you..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, look! He's standing up! I've never seen anything so adorable. You know who it reminds me of..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, no. A person, you know who I mean."
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it! You stay with me. You're the pick of the litter.
C. Montgomery Burns,": Yes... But not completely full, for you see... / ""SOME MEN HUNT FOR SPORT, /OTHERS HUNT FOR FOOD / THE ONLY THING I'M HUNTING FOR / IS AN OUTFIT THAT LOOKS GOOD..."""

C. Montgomery Burns,"SEE MY VEST... / SEE MY VEST... / OH, PLEASE, WON'T YOU SEE MY VEESSSST!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Come on, Smithers. Let's go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for ""Little Monty,"" of course."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Give me that! Now if you'll excuse us, children, the pups have a date with a fashion knife."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now it's simply a matter of bending down and picking up the one and only...
C. Montgomery Burns,But they're so wretchedly adorable! Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns. I can't do it!
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I can't kill you either. Look at you standing there on your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I have. I have! I swear I'll never wear any clothing made from an animal that can do an amusing trick!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I have one last matter of utmost importance. I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena - And it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Sounded large when I ordered it. I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby-traps.
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah! A non-profit organization with oil? I won't allow it! An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of Betsy Bleedingheart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite ""corking"" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I want that oil well! I've got a monopoly to maintain! I own the Electric Company and the Waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I must have that oil! Oogh! Smithers! Smithers, help me subdue this beast!"
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It'll all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.
C. Montgomery Burns,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, that sounds like a larf. Let's try it right now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, yes. I believe that's little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh and there's that, ah Simpson mutt, my former guard dog."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh uh, uh, that's B-Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Dispose of it. And uh, send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah. Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid. Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat, and energy. I call this enemy... the sun!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Since the beginning of time man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing -- block it out.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical lights and heaters running all day long."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take that, bowl-a-rama! Take that, convenience mart! Take that, nuclear power pla-- Oh, fiddlesticks."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit. Perhaps I could sell him a little oil."
C. Montgomery Burns,I've decided to protect myself... Ever since I was attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you all talk big, but who here has the guts to stop me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Mmm hmm. Very well. One last question: Have you ever seen the sun set at 3:00 PM?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Shut up, you! Take one last look at the sun, Springfield."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahhh. Perpetual twilight bathed in the glow of Burns brand electricity!
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello lamp post/ Whatcha knowin'? / I've come to watch your power flowing.
C. Montgomery Burns,"After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way. I feel like celebrating. I..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. Well, I think you'd better drop it. I said drop it! Get your -- get your hands off--"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right. The year is 1965, and you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit. Now let's burn rubber, baby!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Shot? By you? I'm afraid not my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was...
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
C. Montgomery Burns,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... that's the one. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
C. Montgomery Burns,But the old exhume was misleading. Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But finding only slacked jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
C. Montgomery Burns,What? No! With my last ounce of strength I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage... when pigs fly!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Raise your right hock. Aerate! Raise your left hock. Aerate! I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I am pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. What's the name of this gastropod?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Workers, please! There'll be time for the frozen pudding wagon later! You still owe me ten more Iroquois twists!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Homer, your bravery and quick thinking have turned a potential Chernobyl into a mere Three-Mile Island. Bravo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Here's your caption, boys: ""Local Hero shuns spotlight and pitches in!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,Their flower power is no match for my glower power.
C. Montgomery Burns,My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul! They never even had a chance! Whoever did this will never get past me!
C. Montgomery Burns,You just made a very big mistake. You'll spend the rest of your life in pris--
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, I know that woman. But from when and in what capacity?"
C. Montgomery Burns,She has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career criminal.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that ""nice lady"" set the cause of biological warfare back thirty years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, we know you bought the tombstone. We know the fugitive visited that tombstone. Whose tombstone was it?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
C. Montgomery Burns,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired."
C. Montgomery Burns,"But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut."
C. Montgomery Burns,Oooo... I need some more ether. I can still feel the movement of the emery board.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Pop 'n Fresh! You glutinous little doughboy! Oh, there's something I've wanted to do to you for years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, why, certainly, Pop 'n Fresh. I... I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your lucky charms."
C. Montgomery Burns,Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned. Anyway, back to the checks... Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now."
C. Montgomery Burns,I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe... I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at that. All the way to the end with only one push.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes. That silly championship? The only ""ship"" worth a damn is friendship. Look, here comes the friend ship, sailing your way..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight. My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again, and..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! That precision assault popped it back into place! Thank you masked stranger!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you all a little something."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've always been wealthy , but this is the first time I ever felt rich."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,You there -- fill it up with petroleum distillate and re-vulcanize my tyres! Post haste!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle. Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his ""Oh, I can't go to prison, Monty! They'll eat me alive!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cripes, man, can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Where's Homer? Oh, and to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome employees! ""Come in!"" ""The whole night's entertainment is on me"" -- ""Monty Burns!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or ""funkier."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, this novelty foam hand is ludicrously oversized. Go swap it for a smaller one."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You should've seen the murderous glint in his eye, Smithers. And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeld bread."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly I always had my mace."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How am I supposed to do the ""Junior Jumble?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Pull yourself together, man! I dare say you're in need of a long vacation."
C. Montgomery Burns,Tchah! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me. You see? Now I insist you take a vacation just as soon as a temporary substitute can be found.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Really, Smithers, I'll be fine! I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he, anyway?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills."
C. Montgomery Burns,Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to be getting dumber by the minute. I've never seen anything quite like it... Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation."
C. Montgomery Burns,The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it.
C. Montgomery Burns,Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything. A complete moron. But I'm not really free to talk right now.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back."
C. Montgomery Burns,60 watts! What do you think this is -- a tanning salon?
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't seem to be any trick to it... Let's see... Smithers... ""S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S"". Success! It's ringing!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Praise God, I think the thug has finally gone home for the day."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hear that? The percolations are imminent! No need to come in! Cease your ingress!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No... I thought... I thought, uh, I'd chauffeur myself this evening! Yes, that's what I thought. How difficult can it be? I'm sure the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator and which the deceleratrix."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I can't believe it! All my life I've avoided doing things for myself, but I'm actually enjoying this. Plus I'm making incredible time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is 5-2-4-6. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Homer. You've already done more for me than any man. Your brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that being waited on hand and foot is okay for your average Joe, but it's not for me. I want to thank you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, welcome back, Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang up job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in sector 7-G."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers... you're no longer needed at all. You're fired. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Gah! Oh, hello, Mater. Uh... Sorry about pulling the plug on you and all. Who could've known you'd pull through and... live for another five decades? Oh, is my face red..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers! You must have put him up to it! I'm glad I fired you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't need you to do any of this. I'm totally self-sufficient now. What I would like, though, is a Spanish peanut."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a remarkable thing. In the short time you were gone, I learned to be completely self reli--"
C. Montgomery Burns,"-- ant. Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the window... see that he gets what's coming to him."
C. Montgomery Burns,Quite impossible. I can try to bat him off if you like.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Tuttle's Sunday trousers! Fear not, I'll get you to a hospital, the only way I know how. Smithers, you infernal ninny! Stick your left hoof on that flange now!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now if you can get it through your bug-addled brain, jam that second mephitic clod-hopper of yours on the right doo-dad! Now pump those scrawny chicken legs, you stuporous funker!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Simpson, seven gone. As soon as you're in your pressboard coffin, I'll be the sole survivor, and the treasure will be mine!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's exactly the poi-- Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating yourself?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Your clownish behavior notwithstanding, we have made a gentleman's agreement and sworn on our lives to honor it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see... ""Mesmerists,"" ""Dowsers,"" ""Luddites,"" ""Alienists,"" ""Zoroastrians,"" ""Alphabetizers,""... Aha! ""Assassins!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that Simpson boy to take the Hellfish Bonanza, and I can't get it without his key!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, just the man I need. Fernando Vidal, the world's most devious assassin."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm sending you a photo over the Faxtrola. I need you to fly to Springfield and assassinate this man post-haste.
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Dead -- tired,"" but I'm quite refreshed now, thank you."
C. Montgomery Burns,Leave them for whom? The Germans? The folks who shoot at us all day? Let's just take them. We'll all be rich! Rich as Nazis!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Then it's agreed. Of course, we can't sell the paintings now. We'd be caught. How many of you are familiar with the concept of a ""tontine?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Ox. Why don't you take us through it?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well put, Oxford. Now remember, you can't all sign with an X..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've tried to meet you halfway on this, Simpson, but you had to be Little Johnny Live-a-lot. Now give me your key to the Hellfish Bonanza."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you're a good boy. But the child labor people have been watching me like a hawk."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'm off to get the paintings. As they say, time is Monets. As you were, Sergeant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Looks like I didn't need the keys after all. I'll take the masterpieces, thank you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to think, Smithers -- you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. ""Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Honestly, Smithers, I don't know why Harvard even bothers to show up. Heh. They barely even won."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I say let Harvard have its football and academics. Yale will always be first in gentlemanly club-life. Why, every friend I have I made right here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This may take a while, Smithers. Why don't you get drunk and stumble around comically for my amusement?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, what's going on? How dare you interrupt my lime rickey? State your business."
C. Montgomery Burns,You're what? Selling light bulbs? Worried about the whales? Keen on Jesus? Out with it!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times. It was 1941 -- the -- no, '39 -- my 25th Yale reunion..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years, Mimsy Bancroft...Of course, by then Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily."
C. Montgomery Burns,"...where our passions were inflamed by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word ""damn."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum. There under the smiling eyes of four stuffed Eskimos, we expressed our love physically, as was the style at the time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, there was a terrible scandal. Lily's family forced her to give you up and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas. I never heard from her again. But I prattle on -- tell me everything about your life."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well. You must be tired. Let me show you your room.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... All right... Uh-huh... It's good to see you, too... Now then, in case you get bored, here's the playroom."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This show was supposed to close last week! Close this show! Close it, I say!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, I... Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation. I wonder how much I should give..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense, Larry, your blood is bluer than any of theirs! Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, Admiral Carstairs, I'd like you to meet my son, Larry."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's something a bit odd about young Larry. I can't quite put my finger on it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A total lack of refinement. Smithers, send for the boys at Yale Admissions, huh?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Are you mad? I'm not made of airports! Get out!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, ""yakkety-yak-yak""... You, Foodbag -- do you have a son?"
C. Montgomery Burns,And is he a constant disappointment? Does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't believe someone would kidnap my Larry. I won't rest until he's returned to me!
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's the principle, Smithers! Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns, whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, how much proof do you need? Five thousand? Six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got."
C. Montgomery Burns,"There, there, sonny-boy. I suppose I have been a bit... Oh, no, I can't do it. It's just not me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm sorry, Larry, I can't be the family that you need."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, son, delighted to have met you. It's good to know that there's another kidney out there for me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm. One dollar for eternal happiness... Mmmm, I'd be happier with the dollar."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, another Friday is upon us. What'll you be doing, Smithers? Something gay, no doubt."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, lighthearted. Fancy free. ""Mothers lock up your daughters, Smithers is on the town!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love. I bring you fear, famine, pestilence, and..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, the promise of a new day is more than enough exhilaration for me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, something fun. Something the men will enjoy like a safety drill! But what kind?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, meltdown alert? Mad dog drill? Blimp attack? Ah, I think a good old fashioned fire drill today."
C. Montgomery Burns,Is it supposed to take this long? What's a good time for a mass evacuation of the entire plant?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, you won all right. You won more than you bargained for."
C. Montgomery Burns,What a disgraceful display. I've seen more orderly behavior in a Ritz Brothers film. You all need a serious lesson in teamwork.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right. Let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park. This will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. I cannot overemphasize the dangers which... did you bring your family, Simpson?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious ""World's Worst Employee"" trophy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to show that I'm not playing favorites, both Smithers and I will be participating. Who knows? I might be the unlucky one who gets fired. Not bloody likely."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, frankly, you've been a bit of a pill lately."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Prepare for the adventure of a lifetime as you fight for survival against the merciless forces of nature! Toe your marks, get set, go!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, thank you, Simpson. I have been watching my figure."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called ""cheating""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met."
C. Montgomery Burns,We have several hours before the others arrive. What say we get comfy?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now we have electricity. This propane tank will supply us with heat, and this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the cabin."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, Homie old boy. More champagne?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, but I'd trade it all for a little more."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes! That's it! Oh, I could go for one of those right now!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Hope that wasn't an avalanche. Be a chum and have a look-see.
C. Montgomery Burns,"There must be some way to contact the outside world. Ah, the telegraph."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I have a confession. I'm not quite the tunnel digger I made myself out to be."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, good. Let's dig... That's right, dig some more... Oh, we make quite a duo: Burns and associate. No, no, what am I thinking? Burns and... teammate."
C. Montgomery Burns,We... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.
C. Montgomery Burns,We must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm... no books, no radio, no board games. Ah! A Bazooka Joe comic."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I have a better idea! We could build real men. Out of snow."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah. 206 bones... fifty miles of small intestine... full, pouting lips. Why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours."
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at them. Smug and secure in their finery. Mocking us.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch. To watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down."
C. Montgomery Burns,Have you people forgotten our little competition? Last one in the cabin is fired.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Outstanding. Well, perhaps all of this has been worthwhile. Did you all learn about teamwork?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. In that case, no one will be fired after all."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Balderdash. This is the silliest load of... Ooh, look at it fly. Whee! Look at me, Smithers, I feel practically superduperfragicaliexpiala-dohhhh!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Ooh. That takes me back. God bless you Shary Bobbins.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why that canine has the proud bearing and glossy fur coat of a Yale man. Hello, little fella."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I believe this dog was in Skull and Bones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship: these are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital or sitting in some phony baloney church. Or synagogue. Questions?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term, you adorable little ragamuffin."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor? Well, maybe she should have thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison monkeys. Nature started the fight for survival and now she wants to quit because she's losing? Well, I say ""hard cheese!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,I've called you all here because I need some honest answers. What is my current financial situation?
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right. Well, let's have a look at my stock portfolio."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, here's where I stopped checking it last time: September nineteen twenty ni-- Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Smithers, why didn't you tell me about this market crash?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's your excuse for everything. I've got to do something to get my money back quickly. This calls for an aggressive trading strategy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take fifty percent of my money and put it in the blue chips: Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats, Congreve's Inflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore Opera Hat Company. That should set things right again, eh, boys?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I see it all now! You're just a bunch of yesmen! I was making the wrong moves and you were too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Then I'll fix this myself. Smithers, take out another mortgage on the plant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, here's a chance to earn my keep. I will go out and get these items from the food jobber."
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh my... I wonder which is the cereal for me...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, oh, excuse me, can you tell me where I might find the ""Burns-O's""?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm. Well, I suppose this one looks a bit like me..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, thank you, Shoppie. I... I ventured in to search for milk when the door snapped shut behind me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... Ugh. I'm in way over my head."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Egad, man, how are we supposed to pass the time?"
C. Montgomery Burns,So this is how the Monty Burns saga ends... If I hadn't surrounded myself with those spineless yes men...
C. Montgomery Burns,"It doesn't matter what your name is, you idiot! What I want to know is: will you help me get my money back?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes! That's the kind of moxie I'm looking for. You're hired!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not now, Smithers. I've got an empire to rebuild, and the person who's going to help me is... that girl!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns and I want your daughter to help make me rich again."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, the baby who shot me. No, I was referring to your other daughter."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've realized the error of my ways, Lisa. I need someone with your integrity to help me. Please don't refuse this poor old man."
C. Montgomery Burns,Nothing evil. That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal.
C. Montgomery Burns,You mean there are actually people who will pay good money for garbage?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't pooh-pooh a nickel, Lisa. A nickel will buy you a steak and kidney pie, a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake, and a newsreel! With enough change leftover to ride the trolley from Battery Park to the Polo Grounds."
C. Montgomery Burns,"My first dollar! Thanks to you, Lisa, and our hemp-smoking friend. Shine on, you crazy diamond."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Lisa, as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. I'm on my way back to the top. I've turned these cans into ""can do!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you've really turned my life around these past few weeks, Lisa. I've got my own business again, my beloved employees... oh consargnit. Eh, come on, let's pick up the pace, you neglected old nincompoops!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, capital idea, partner. People, if we meet this week's quota, I'll take you to the most duck-filled pond you ever sat by."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, everyone. But -- 10% of your applause should go to my little partner, Lisa Simpson. For if it were not for her infectious moralizing, we would not be here today to witness the unveiling of... The Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Would you like to be the first to take a tour of the plant, Li'l Lisa?"
C. Montgomery Burns,The whole plant is a environmentally-sound. It's powered by old newspapers. The machinery is made entirely of used cans. And the windows are from the old liquor bottles we collected.
C. Montgomery Burns,I thought I told you to stop licking my windows!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hold your accolades to the end of the tour. You haven't seen the best part!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I couldn't watch your demonstration of the fish caught in the plastic rings without getting an idea. Look out over the water.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish, a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch."
C. Montgomery Burns,I call it the Burns Omni-Net. It sweeps the sea clean.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I call our product: Li'l Lisa's Patented Animal Slurry! It's a high-protein feed for farm animals, insulation for low-income housing, a powerful explosive, and a top-notch engine coolant. And best of all, it's made from 100% recycled animals!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, a spoonful of slurry will cure what ails ya!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't understand. Pigs need food, engines need coolant, dynamiters need dynamite. I'm supplying it to them, at a tidy profit, and not a single sea creature was wasted. You inspired it all, Li'l Lisa."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I think you will. You see, I've just sold the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant for 120 million dollars!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't congratulate me, congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks... as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent of the proceeds."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers. A real scrapper. A self-made man like me. Bring this Grimes fellow to me. I want to make him my executive vice president."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? Oh, yes. That fellow. Well, just put him somewhere out of the way and find that dog."
C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you destroy my valuable wall and spill my priceless acid?! Did you really think you were going to get away with it?
C. Montgomery Burns,Silence! I'm going to give you one more chance -- at a reduced salary. So straighten up and fly right!
C. Montgomery Burns,"...and the bold, new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today could make thousands of jobs like yours obsolete!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hot tub? Media room? It's supposed to be a power plant, not Aunt Beulah's Bordello. Thank you. Get out. Next."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, fiddle-faddle. Everyone knows our mutants have flippers. Oops. I've said too much. Smithers, use the amnesia ray."
C. Montgomery Burns,Precisely. And be sure to wipe your own memory clear when you're finished.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, why haven't I heard of this ""The Leader?"" He's as rich and wicked as I, but he seems to enjoy tax exempt status."
C. Montgomery Burns,You're right. We're getting screwed! There must be something I can do about this. Wait! Yes! I think I know just the thing!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, of course, the plan! You see me as a God, right Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy hoy, lowly mortals! In addition to working for me, you may now praise me as your Almighty!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"The electric chair is on, eh? Then the old prison has been getting free electricity for thirty years. I'll put a stop to that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Since I've never seen you before, maybe it is your first day. Very well, carry on."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, really? Why did you think you could lie to me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, stop fishing for compliments, Smithers. Go home to your can of mushroom soup."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm... A pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Very well, come on in. Perhaps I have something I can scald you with."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It'll, uh, be a few minutes. So, what brings you to my home?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're from Collier's magazine, aren't you? Are you going to put me in Star Snoop?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, of course, I didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to Spring Byington, do you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in."
C. Montgomery Burns,Here's a scoop for your readers: the Hall of Patriots.
C. Montgomery Burns,That intrepid lad is my great grandfather! Franklin Jefferson Burns. Tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the Fenway Flounder.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh-ho, that's me all right, standing up against America's reckless, spendthrift politicians. It commemorates my liberation of a trillion dollars that would have been foolishly squandered."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? I keep the real bill right here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm not the thief, the government is. Every year you make hard-working Joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? Aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ohh, you can silence me, but you can't silence Collier's magazine! Tell the people! Don't let the government push you around! You have a choice! Fight back!"
C. Montgomery Burns,No. We need help. And there's only one man who can get us out of a jam like this.
C. Montgomery Burns,"...So now, our own government is hunting us down like a couple of common snow leopards."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Capital idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. We'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of Uncle Sam."
C. Montgomery Burns,Any of these islands would make a fine new country.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooo, there's a big one. And it has freedom written all over it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry about the landing, boys. This fog is so thick I can't see my own cataracts."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahhh, the new Packard we've been hearing so much about."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well in that case, just take us to whoever's in charge."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so the island's not for sale, eh? Well, will you at least permit us to live in your socialist paradise?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Exactly. All we ask is preferential treatment because of my fabulous wealth.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I, too, feel renewed appreciation for the good old U.S. of A. Oppression and harassment are a small price to pay to live in the land of the free."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that, too. And if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty of that!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, do you think maybe my power plant killed those ducks?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well then, get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, Skinner, we haven't got all day. Kill the horrid beasts, then do away with their lizards."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, you're in the way! Are you daft, woman?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, let's see what I've packed for myself today. One bouillon cube, one concord grape, one Philly cheesesteak, and a jar of garlic pickles. No one will want to kiss me after these, eh, Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, those people are all gristle. I want this jar open."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, for goodness sake. What we need around here is some fresh blood."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no. To attract top graduates, we'll need to make a recruitment film. A picture that showcases our cutting edge technology."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, brilliant! That's just the kind of far-out gimmick we need."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm just thinking of my employees -- all the card sharps, bottom dealers, and shills. Where will they go?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? Keep up the good work, Max."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, he's a bit listless, isn't he? Give me... Ooh, that spirited fellow..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oof. Well, he didn't put up much of a fight. Uh, why don't you pick one for me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"On second thought, I'll just have a glass of milk. From that cow."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, years ago, I blew the chance to buy Picasso's ""Guernica"" for a song. Luckily, that song was ""White Christmas,"" and by hanging onto it, I made billions."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Anyway, I love this hideous thing. Young lady, I'll take it!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Smithers, you say you painted all your Navy buddies this way?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, tarnation! I've got to see what the excitement's about. Make way! Doctor coming through."
C. Montgomery Burns,Books and cocoa in the same store? What's next? A talking banana?
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, of course not. The very notion of a talking banana is absurd! Still."
C. Montgomery Burns,That flamboyant fop! He's got them eating out of his hand.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, bosh. Anyone can lead a conga line. Hop to it, Smithers. Con-ga, con-ga, con-ga!"
C. Montgomery Burns,We love Monty Burns more. / Con-ga like you mean it. / Please don't make me shock you...
C. Montgomery Burns,The man has no idea how to behave like a billionaire. Where's the dignity? Where's the contempt for the common man?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I thought I had everything. Money, good looks, strong sharp teeth... But what's it all worth when nobody likes you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I want you to look at me the way I saw you look at Arthur Fortune.
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes! That's the look I'm looking for. What would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah-ha! This is a great idea, Simpson. Free silver dollars! Compliments of C. Montgomery Burns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I can't believe it. I'm still not among the hundred most popular billionaires. I'm behind Adam Sandler, for God's sake!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"A charitable donation, eh? Well, there's a first time for everything."
C. Montgomery Burns,Take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the Springfield Hospital.
C. Montgomery Burns,Now there's nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the kudos to roll in.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, Teedily deedily dee dee. Teedily dee dee dee. Woo hoo hoo. Hee hee hee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's it, the radio! I'll go on the most popular program of the day. I assume that's still Don MacNeil and his Breakfast Club."
C. Montgomery Burns,What's the matter? Think I'm not hip? I don't have enough vo-dee-oh-doh?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Mr. Rude, I just want you to know I'm a good sport. If you want to make fun of my legendary love of cashews, you have at it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, about forty, I suppose. When are we going on the air?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, well, when I was six, my father took me on a picnic. That was a gay old time. Oh-ho, I ate my share of wieners that day."
C. Montgomery Burns,Stop that! Attention wireless listeners! Most of the sounds you are now hearing are not being made by me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh... What's the use? I'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like Arthur Fortune."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, if a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"The beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal that has 24 miles of water to hide in. Drain the lake."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was a little worried when he swallowed me, but... well, you know the rest. And now for my triumphant return to Springfield."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, thank you everyone. And now, presenting the ninth wonder of the world, the eighth being Gomer Pyle's heavenly singing voice... I give you! -- the Loch Ness Monster!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, you're too kind. Yes, that's it, let it all out. Clutch me to your common bosom."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no! Stop it! Stop it! You'll enrage the beast!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahhh!! Stop it! You're blinding me! No, I can't see!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, perhaps you're right. I got so swept up with the notion of being liked, I completely forgot who I am. I'm a selfish old crank and that fits me like a Speedo."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, no, I really want to give the lovable scamp a good home."
C. Montgomery Burns,And hoarding! Leave it to the Democrats to let the Spaniards back in the pantry.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, there's an employee, Smithers. A smile on his lips and a song in his heart. Promote him!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't give me that kiss of death, you black widow!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, okay... let's see... I don't have a speech prepared, but uh, abra-cadaver..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..."" I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now that I'm the town's oldest man, I'm starting to realize I'm not a young man anymore. I'll have to start taking better care of myself. You know, I haven't had a medicino checkup in ages."
C. Montgomery Burns,But I'll need someone to watch my house. Who's that fellow who always screws up and creates havoc?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. The way I figure it, he's due for a good performance."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now if the house catches fire, I want you to call this number."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see, social security number... naught-naught-naught, naught-naught, naught-naught-naught-two. Damn Roosevelt. Cause of parents' death... Got in my way."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Doctor, I want you to test me for everything. Every disease on this chart."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, try this arm. I saw some blood in there the other day."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Doc, I think I did pretty well on my tests. You may shake my hand if you like."
C. Montgomery Burns,I see. You're sure you just haven't made thousands of mistakes?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, old chum, there's nothing like coming home with a clean bill of health. Oh, and sorry about your news."
C. Montgomery Burns,Do they know how many eggs it laid in your brain?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, let's see. Ming vase on narrow column, not knocked down... priceless coins not used in vending machine..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Furious George! What have they done to your beautiful face?!
C. Montgomery Burns,"There, there. Smithers, this monkey's going to need most of your skin."
C. Montgomery Burns,I've just reviewed your ten-year performance record and it's appalling.
C. Montgomery Burns,I think I know who Homer Simpson is. In ten short years you've caused seventeen meltdowns! One is too many!
C. Montgomery Burns,You sold weapons-grade plutonium to the Iraqis! With no mark-up!
C. Montgomery Burns,"And worst of all, you took the ""Hamburglar's"" birthday off last Monday and Wednesday! Which is it? Now, my voice is giving out, so I'm just going to poke you for the next hour or so."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, tell me, are all you government inspectors so handsome and strapping?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course not. He's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. B... Oh, God! What's he doing?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, why did you iron a crease in these dungarees? I look like a square."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A show about a doll? Why not write a musical about the common cat? Or the King of Siam? Give it up, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoa, whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a New Mexico?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, with the old ball and chain gone, maybe I can finally have a little fun at the office."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bah! A candy shop. Yes, I'll take two pounds of Bristol's toffee. Ooh, and don't wrap it too tightly - I'm hungry now!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmmm. What is this? Some kind of force-field around these vegetables.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's keep the laughs coming, eh, Simpson? What say I make you my Executive In Charge Of Recreation -- No, no, better yet, my Prank Monkey."
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't have my little monkey running around in rags.
C. Montgomery Burns,"What are you doing, man? That's Carl! Let me help you."
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at that Comic Book Fellow calmly eating candy like a Spaniard. Time for monkey to shine.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're so much more fun than Smithers. Why, he doesn't know the meaning of the word ""gay."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at their proud, hopeful faces. Wait'll they see that their rare Chinese panda is nothing but a fat guy in a suit."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well done, Monkey! That other panda gave some unexpected zazz to the festivities, eh?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting -- it's happened before. Monty say, monkey do. What could be better?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, well, it looks like my monkey has evolved into a man."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silence, Monkey. Now that you're Father Christmas, we have an opportunity to bend this town over our knee and give it a pranking it will never forget. Here's what we do..."
C. Montgomery Burns,I hope no one finds out about this. It's pure journalistic dynamite!
C. Montgomery Burns,Then it's agreed. I'll supply you terrorists with deadly uranium.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ohh, don't worry about those fumes. They'll be sucked into that air vent."
C. Montgomery Burns,It seems the Federales have been tipped off by an anonymous whistle blower.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, while the plant is brought up to code, there will be massive layoffs. That is to say, total layoffs. Toodles!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll get the ball out of your peach basket one of these days.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hurry, Smithers. Halloween is upon us. Put up the decoration."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Fourteen dollars and ten, eleven, twelve cents. There you go."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, General Gao... you were a bloodthirsty foe, but your chicken is delectable."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hm, this cookie feels heavy, as if there's some paper inside."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Capital! ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" Why it's Flag Day today! True love at last."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No time for jokes, Smithers! Come along. We're going womanizing."
C. Montgomery Burns,...So I foreclosed on her mortgage and took her cats!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damn that Pennybags. Between him and Scrooge McDuck, all the best ankle is taken."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Great heavens! It's one of those nude female fire stations. Ohh, I'd always be second place to some kitten stuck in a tree. Let's go, Smithers. Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that fortune promised me true love. This has been the worst Flag Day ever."
C. Montgomery Burns,Of course you do. You can lift my wiper any day.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Miss, would you submit to a wooing by a gentleman caller?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I've never dated anyone with their original hair and teeth."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I enjoy all the popular youth trends. Like, uh, mm...piloting motorcoaches... and, uh..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, what shall we do tomorrow? Go grousing? Or if you'd rather stay home, you could sing while I accompany you on the clavichord."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I've got some wonderful stereopticon images of the Crimean war."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, balderdash! It's not important how old you are on parchment, it's how old you feel in the humors."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, there's one of my young chums now. You there!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Play along, Chubsy. There's a pie in it for you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well done, young man. Your youthful trendiness will come in handy throughout the courting process. Because these days..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"D-- Oh, uh, constantly. When we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! Eh, pally?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm going to make such love to you that, oh, you'll forget all about Rudolph Valentino. Turn left here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, but I have a little secret. I've obtained a rare, powerful aphrodisiac."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It was made from the pockets of the pocket fox, an animal that only existed for three weeks in the sixteenth century."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh. Once again, my dear, you've beaten two strapping young bucks."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In time, in time. I need to speak with you in private."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, my biological clock is ticking. I could be dead again soon."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait, my dear. I think you'll find that red ball more ""engaging."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, spectacular! Now we must celebrate -- I'll get some Champagne-iola."
C. Montgomery Burns,This is the happiest day of my life. Nothing could spoil it. Absolutely nothing.
C. Montgomery Burns,Kaloo-kalei! We're in luck! They had a magnum at the shoe counter. Now for... Gloria?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't understand. She was my young, sexy fiancÃ©e, he was my sexually virile best friend, and they just drove off in my Bugatti Sexarossa. How could this ever have happened?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care if she's Miss Hairless America... I'm spoken for. Now step aside -- I'll save Gloria myself.
C. Montgomery Burns,Who am I kidding? I'm just a feeble old man.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart."
C. Montgomery Burns,What do I have to do? Grow a devil beard?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've been expecting this day for thirty years. In a way, it's a relief. But in another way, it's most unwelcome."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm afraid that skull belongs to my dear friend... Waylon Smithers, Sr."
C. Montgomery Burns,"If you see only one film this year that proves my innocence, make it this one."
C. Montgomery Burns,Why are these numbers so high? Why is that red light flashing?
C. Montgomery Burns,"And what's that alarming sound? Smithers, get in here! Smithers!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Will you put that baby down? There's something wrong with the reactor core.
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Waylon Senior! It could be filled with atoms and steam and other nuclear bric-a-brac."
C. Montgomery Burns,So... you're a baby huh? How's that working out for you?
C. Montgomery Burns,Making funny faces. Falling to the floor. Shedding his hair. Lying perfectly still...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers Sr. gave his life to save the plant. And, since cover-ups were all the rage back then, I shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe. I never told Smithers the truth about his father."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Waylon, but I wanted to spare you the details of your father's gruesome death."
C. Montgomery Burns,I told him his father was killed in the Amazon by a tribe of savage women.
C. Montgomery Burns,I've got the answer. Just let me run this church like a business.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's just a skip-rope rhyme. Believe me, the Lord's gonna go for this in a big way. Now, who's with me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,This is Lindsay Naegle. And don't let the skirt fool you -- she'll have this place making money in no time.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh. Well, we highly value your input. Until you sign the deal!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to Thursday night vespers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So the good news is, church revenues are up one thousand and seventy-three percent."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's get started. First I'd like to announce that thanks to the magic of Disney Animatronics, Strom Thurmond will live another hundred years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Moving on to new business, what act of unmitigated evil shall the Republican party undertake this week?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Get a grip, Simpson. You're doing fine. Now, do you have your map?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, the music is from Southern Hungary. That's quite an ear -- have some money."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""...I hope you don't think our IPO is an IPU."" Then I hold my nose thusly. What do you think, Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I hope the investors like it. I have to raise sixty million dollars or we're out of business."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I told you, I pissed it away. Oh, don't make that face."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I need someone who laughs at all my jokes. You know, honest feedback."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, you're a Happy Homer. What's your name, young man?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, if you liked that, listen to this: ""Working hard... or hardly working?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, you could learn a thing or two from this braying moron. Young man, I'm making you my executive vice president."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, I would have said anything to get your stem cells. Now, welcome aboard."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy-hoy, executive V.P. I'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors and I need your generous guffaws."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll either tickle your ribs or feed them to my dogs! Now we're ordering out. What would you like on your pizza pie? Extra cheese?! Who do you take me for? Lorenzo De Medici?
C. Montgomery Burns,So profit margins will be thinner than Louise Brooks' negligee.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm going to take a bathiola. When I come back, you'd better be laughing."
C. Montgomery Burns,Brilliant! We lost sixty million dollars and they're cheering for more!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I regained consciousness during my big dance number. Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and you didn't? Well, the worm has finally shown his fangs. Smithers, make me slap him."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now both. Now just you. Now give me a taste. Now both again...
C. Montgomery Burns,I stand here to expose the criminal ineptitude of Homer J. Simpson. Again and again he has brought this town to the brink of annihilation.
C. Montgomery Burns,Why are you laughing? His bungling has shortened your lives and mutated your children.
C. Montgomery Burns,No problem. We've siphoned off extra power from the orphanage. Who are they going to complain to -- their parents?
C. Montgomery Burns,YOU MAKE ME FEEL AS YOUNG / AS THE BLOOD I GET FROM SHEEP.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Finally Smithers, a device worthy of storing my top-secret enemies list."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, fellow Republicans. To start with the old business, Brother Hibbert will read a report on our efforts to rename everything after Ronald Reagan."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Now, to the matter at hand. Who will we put up for young Wilcox's congressional seat?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No problem, we'll say you were on a fact finding mission."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, have you now? Well huzzah, huzzah. I'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And what book is that? The Ape Who Wanted A Big Bonus? Stop wasting my time, you corn-fed man-cow."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers. The environmental effects won't be visible for years."
C. Montgomery Burns,I wouldn't go to jail. The legal owner of this plant would:
C. Montgomery Burns,"This entire plant is in his name -- so when they come to put C. M. Burns in jail, it's the canary that does the time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes. Tycoons have been doing it for years. Why, Standard Oil was once owned by a half-eaten breakfast."
C. Montgomery Burns,The owner of the plant is gone. All that's left is this little mirror he used to amuse himself.
C. Montgomery Burns,Good Lord! That canary was supposed to be my pigeon. I need to find a patsy quick!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, hello. Now, I need to find a patsy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're quite the friendly fellow, but right now I'm looking for a patsy."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You bumbling fool, I keep telling you I'm looking for a patsy."
C. Montgomery Burns,This moon-faced simpleton is continually interrupting my search for a patsy! Hello.
C. Montgomery Burns,"... Now, a few more details about this year's company picnic. It's at the plant, no food will be served, the only activity will be work, and the picnic is cancelled."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Finally, I would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now Mr. Homer J. Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. I only have one thing to say to that... bravo."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We clashed lances on the Champs de Mars, and I have been bested. The plant is yours. Treat her well."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, now that I'm forcibly retired, I feel I should give back to society and do some charitable work. But first, I want to take a lot of opium."
C. Montgomery Burns,He's doing eighty years on an opium bust. I never saw a man take to a Turkish prison so quickly.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I worked here for three-score and twain. That's sixty-two years in the ""New English"". Now, come with me, I want to show you something."
C. Montgomery Burns,These are the people in my life I could never find time for because I was too busy working.
C. Montgomery Burns,"This was my fiancÃ©e, Gertrude. I was working so hard I missed our wedding, our honeymoon and our divorce proceedings. She died of loneliness. Loneliness and rabies."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Steal my plant will you? By the time you wake up, you'll be walled inside my mausoleum forever!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Exquisite, just exquisite. Makes me wish I hadn't released the hounds."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, you're the first one here! Please accept this free ticket to the 1939 World's Fair."
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh no! The Pawnee have returned. They probably want their souls back.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Kent, I want everyone in your radio picture audience to know that this woman is a menace to decent people and germ warriors everywhere."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Curse that ""Groovy Granny""! This is America. Justice should favor the rich!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And so in the spirit of fence-mending and grudge-not-bearing, I hereby rename the Burns Germ Warfare Lab The Grandma Simpson Peace Museum and Kid-teractive Learnatorium."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Grandma Simpson, will you be the first to sign the museum's guest book?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've got it all on this dictabelt. Move in, boys!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Supplying false information on a national park register is a federal offense...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Which you've committed at every national park, from Acadia to Zion. You're going away for a long time, Mrs. Simpson. Or should I call you..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Let's see... what's the smallest amount of money I can think of? A thousand dollars!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Young man, I believe you have something that belongs to me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"When the errant bill struck my chest, it left a distinctive bruise. Had my heart been inside at the time, it could have been fatal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, everyone. It's time for your Christmas ""boni."" Everyone gets a five dollar cafeteria voucher...and for your boy, a confectioner's card featuring a current baseballer. It's that rookie from the New York Nine."
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes... it seems they've started letting ethnics into the big leagues.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, particularly their supple young organs. Oh unfenced back yard pools, where would I be without you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, we're well-protected against every threat, from bomb-toting Bolsheviks, to golden-armed jazzbos."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, the board of directors is coming here today, and I don't want them to see Snap, Crackle and Pop down there."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's. Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers whilst drooling over French postcards."
C. Montgomery Burns,Another employee family wedding. What's the traditional peasant gift in these parts? A milking cow?
C. Montgomery Burns,See if Lenny wants to go in on a spoon.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! I'm docking you a day's pay."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Attention: while you've been showering here, I sold all your clothes."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson! You'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Silence! Or I'll chop you into suet for my murderous gerbils and hamsters.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait, I have a better idea. You'll work for me now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man."
C. Montgomery Burns,Do as I say or I'll tell the police. You'll do so much community service.
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right. All his talk of peace and love is really honking off my red Chinese masters. Now Smithers, walk me around the park until I fall asleep. I'm feeling fussy."
C. Montgomery Burns,You have no choice. Pie him or I'll reveal your secret to the world!
C. Montgomery Burns,Knock-kneed home renters. Can't we thin this herd with some smallpox-infected blankets?
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't I already give out turkey slices to the poor?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Because of my svelte physique, I was able to fit in a narrow air pocket."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thankfully, a mother mole nursed me as her own until I was strong enough to continue."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, let's see how the common folk are grieving for their fallen god... me."
C. Montgomery Burns,This town cared more for a soulless piece of granite than for me! I don't have a friend in the world.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'm going to change this town's accurate impression of me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"They were getting too grabby! All right, I know how to change the way the public thinks of me: I'll buy every media outlet in town. Bring me a checkbook and a mother mole!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, it's time to win the love of these hateful morons. Step one: amass a vast media empire."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, first of all, I agree with you two: it's sheer humbuggery that pretty girls can flirt their way out of speeding tickets."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Secondly, I want you to pack up and get out. I just bought this station -- and you're fired!"
C. Montgomery Burns,And play that delightful flush sound on your way out.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've done it, Smithers! I've bought every media outlet in town -- TV, radio, even the skywriters..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. But uh, put a little more apple in my cheek."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Splendid! Now, let's see how I'm faring on the jumping box."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, do you know Bill from accounting? That's his daughter!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Very well, you had your chance. I'm going to shred you like a Christmas card! Now, get out."
C. Montgomery Burns,So... what do you think of today's popular music scene?
C. Montgomery Burns,This is an outrage! Since when are public figures fair game for satire?
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't be held responsible for what my goons were ordered to do!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Non-violence never solved anything! Fine, curtsy boy, I'll try it your way."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good God, I'm at war with a little girl... and I'm losing!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Blast! Well, gather their watches. I must find another way to vanquish the girl..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, has your daughter always been such a righteous little rabble-rouser?"
C. Montgomery Burns,You saw right through me. Well done! Have some congratulatory drugs.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, tell me more about your daughter. And speak into the lamp."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I guess it's impossible to control all the media -- unless of course, you're Rupert Murdoch. He is one beautiful man."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm a proud fellow, and it's not easy for me to admit defeat. But I know just the thing to make me feel better -- shopping!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Stop that! The felt is slicing through me like a knife!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, I insist you take off your shoes when you get inside. And uh, while you're in there, grab as much cancer as you can."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cheer up, my chubby inner child. I've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. Because I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! There seems to be some sort of communiquÃ© on that man's blouse.
C. Montgomery Burns,You're suspended without pay! Take your clacking balls and go.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And on your way out, remove all the fillings you got under our dental plan."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good riddance to bad blubber. Smithers, want to go get a cup of coffee?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, well, if it isn't my favorite employee and his spouse. And these must be children. Have a ginger root."
C. Montgomery Burns,I flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. Then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. Then the FÃ¼hrer fired me.
C. Montgomery Burns,Very well... effective immediately the employee prescription drug program is terminated.
C. Montgomery Burns,"In these days of rising health care costs... blah blah blah... lip service, lip service... get out."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that was a pretty good party. Do you think Carol from payroll and Mike from shipping are going to hook up?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, there's nothing like canceling an employee drug plan to make one feel so at peace with the universe."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm so sick of you, Smithers. Your toadying, your complete agreeability, your gasping on the floor... Wha?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers! If this is some sort of hijink, stop it immediately."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Confound it, man! I need your throat clear and ready for perjury."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Fear not, Smithers. I'll move Heaven and Earth to save you! It's still easier than teaching a new assistant my filing system."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, you fool. 'Tis I, Burns! Now come with me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"At last, my plane shall be used for its original purpose. To subvert the laws of the United States."
C. Montgomery Burns,It's no use. We've got to make an emergency landing.
C. Montgomery Burns,And these two are gifts for my nephews. Tally ho!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's not working. Only my sour, curdled breath will quicken him."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Smithers, I was a stingy old fool. But from now on, I'll provide drug benefits to all my full-time employees."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, we could make a fortune with these Bible pictures. And I've been looking for a way to launder the money I made selling club soda as flu vaccine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No! As your financial backer, I insist upon reality. Pharaoh didn't put the sound in later!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh really? And what will you use instead of nuclear power?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I know when I've been licked. Sorry, Ned. This movie will never be seen again."
C. Montgomery Burns,Dis-embroider the crew jackets. We can still send them back.
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't see why I need a new driving license. My old one's just fine.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Do you know this baby once out-raced the Flying Finn, Paavo Nurmi?"
C. Montgomery Burns,What are you talking about? This car is cooler than Guy Lombardo.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Stop that, you want-wit! I might get stung by a bumbled-bee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"If you hand over the concert hall to me, I'll assume the debt and all of your problems will disappear."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I haven't seen so many drugs in a wang since I ran a Chinese opium den!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Crack, smack, uppers, downers, outters, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines, LSD mach three, and trace amounts of human urine!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Gentlemen, my prison is losing money. We need more convicts in the dungeonareum."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now, there are perks. A private cell, extra dessert... and this adorable little hat."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well I'll make these rioters regret their folly. This prison will make Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons. Smithers, we'll need electrical wire, a hood and someone who can really point at genitalia."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll have you know I buy the finest cuts of beef.
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, sorry. My diamonds are going to be retro-morphed into coal... the most valuable substance on earth. I know. I'll send you to Yale, with the Monty Burns Scholarship."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't be so quick to say no. The ladies love an ivy-leaguer...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Smithers. Nice of you to drop by... after my life was saved."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Aw, that's cute. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, all! Now to explain why I summoned you here."
C. Montgomery Burns,You're here to participate in a hunt for the world's most dangerous game.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, because I am too kind, I will give you all a five-minute head start. You may commence running."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that broke the ice. Now, any man who lives till noon tomorrow shall win his freedom."
C. Montgomery Burns,The game is afoot! I smell fear... mixed with curry!
C. Montgomery Burns,"You can't escape me, Simpson -- you're not smart enough!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Instead of donating this money, I'm going to use it to extend my own life another ten minutes. Smithers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Who's a stinky dog? You are! Michelle's going to work on you today.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Remind me, Smithers: while we're out, I need to get my eyes re-balled and my brain flushed out with vinegar."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Enough! While you morons are canoodling, someone's burgling my miscellania!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Try to take my eggs will you? Well, this rooster has a beak! A beak which calls out death-a-doodle-doo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. I'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and I'll let you go."
C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you mock my mobile-a-mobile? It was the first car to outrun a man.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of all the... I will not be lampooned by school children. Kill them, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,I won't forget who mocked me! I'm taking your picture!
C. Montgomery Burns,I just bought a new car. A nice foreign number... the Lamborgotti Fasterossa.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I need you to pick up my car at the factory in Italy, and ship it directly back to me. I'll save thousands in taxes!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Where is my roadster? You were due back a month ago!
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, he's out getting a spray-on tan. He comes back orange and stains the furniture -- the man's a walking creamsicle!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes -- and therein lies a tale of woe and heartbreak. One I couldn't possibly recount.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, here's the story: I belong to a very exclusive club -- The Excluders' Club..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Nuclear power. I make money using my brain... not sticking a pole in the ground and praying for goo.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I had but one item left on the list... ""A picture of myself with a smiling child."" What could be easier?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"With nowhere else to turn, I spent the first three days with relatives."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I had to get a job. And I had to start at the bottom. But to get to the bottom, I had to work my way up from Moe's."
C. Montgomery Burns,"At five-fifteen an hour, it would take an eternity to make my fortune back -- and FICA wasn't helping."
C. Montgomery Burns,"But then, for once in my life, things went my way."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you poor man. You're about to get a lot poorer."
C. Montgomery Burns,"...so without my beloved nuclear plant, I have nothing to live for."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take me, a barren old thistle, and spare this sweet young flower!"
C. Montgomery Burns,The sheep was no danger at all. I sacrificed my gorgeous body for nothing. This must be what it's like to have a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns,A picture of me with a smiling child?! I can get my plant back!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Before we begin the movie, please join me in a moment of silence for the workers who gave their lives in an heroic --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"What a great film, and I think it makes a terrific point: effective immediately, I'm closing the plant and moving all operations to India."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, your jobs are safe. They'll just be done by someone else in another country."
C. Montgomery Burns,"However, federal law requires I keep one union worker on the payroll. So congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet."
C. Montgomery Burns,The energy generated here is transmitted through undersea cables right back to America.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, I'd like to introduce you to your new manager. You'll find his integrity and dedication make him untouchable."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Classic. Now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"He's got them eating out of his hand. And to think you doubted him, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our American plant ever did."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see what you're saying. We're crowding your plate. In fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. Let's go, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Absolutely not! When it comes to running a nuclear power plant, this man's a god."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a dinner engagement. I don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold."
C. Montgomery Burns,No office talk. I'm floating down the Ganges with my new chums.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, Smithers, ""I told you so"" has a brother. His name is ""shut the hell up."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Same boat, but uh, take it anyway. They use the boat for a Dixieland Booze Cruise while we're gone."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Up until now I was with you. Even the beast on beast combat, that had potential."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I guess we'll have to relocate to an area where the workers are more desperate and ignorant. Springfield."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Go ahead and join them, Smithers. I know you want to."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes Nelson, of course I'll help... And a haw-haw to you!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"My fat friend, you are hanging by a very thin thread..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"If you want to keep your job, then you better start... BA-BA, BA-BA, BA-BA-BA-BA-BA..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're thinking about that ice cream truck, aren't you? Well, you can just forget about..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Come and lick me, Big Boy! I said lick me!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"As for the rest of you, you're supposed to be a chair-hockey team! All I see is five show-boaters!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Smithers, I need your advice picking out a gift for a very dear friend of mine. A single fellow, a bit quiet, but one with a warm loyal heart."
C. Montgomery Burns,Are you going to that string quartet thing? 'Cause I'm not.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm your cellmate. You never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I spent thirty years digging this tunnel, but now I can't use it. I'm simply too old."
C. Montgomery Burns,"But you can escape -- and use this map to retrieve my buried treasure. With it, you can have your revenge!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, I want to know that I had one friend. Also, because while you slept, I violated you repeatedly."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Shut up, you waste of skin and fat! You've desecrated my every possession!"
C. Montgomery Burns,...and that's how I got the vending machine contract for the Kremlin.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, I see by your tie you're a Yale man, too. Let's croon, shall we? BOOLA BOOLA / BOOLA BOOLA..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. But since I thought you were dead, you won't get paid this week. Make a note of it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Go back to your tenements, where the O'Briens live next to the Goldbergs, who rub elbows with Antonellis, and the only thing you have in common is the squalor of your chamber pot. Oh how I hate you! Bye-bye."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why do I need another penny? I have billions. Still, if I don't take it, that hoodlum over there might."
C. Montgomery Burns,You saved my life. There must be something I can do for you...
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll pick you up at five tomorrow. And I'll pick you up right now.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Chicago, eh? Well what if I took us there now?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And just so you know, she'll do anything for you. Anything except sex. And I do mean anything."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie."
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh hush! Now let's enjoy the Miami of Canada -- Chicago!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see, I'll take his liver, a case of Adam's apples, that motorcycle man's moustache..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La BohÃ¨me. I want you to sing the lead."
C. Montgomery Burns,I want you to eliminate this reporter: Kent Brockman. He found the gully where I dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.
C. Montgomery Burns,So it's agreed: we cancel the rest of the primaries and offer the G.O.P. nomination to this knee-high want-wit.
C. Montgomery Burns,But at least he won! The second time... assuming they don't find those ballot boxes in Ohio...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hey, I've seen your wife. She's no Mamie Van Doren."
C. Montgomery Burns,I suppose there's no harm in telling you. I'm using the rocket to dispose of Springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the Amazon rainforest!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've won every coin. But I feel strangely empty. Ooh, there's another coin. That should do it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmm... I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, but the problem is, if you had it, I wouldn't. You see the difficulty..."
C. Montgomery Burns,I only gave him four cents for that nickel! Monty Burns wins a--
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, my nuclear plant did that. And now that you know, your life is in danger."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense, young Woosterfield! Your fortune is greater than mine. It is-it is I who am at your service. Smithers! Fetch us some lemonade!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Premix?! I beg your forgiveness, lad. Smithers! Pour it down your pants."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, Master Simon, I too was once the youngest in a wealthy family."
C. Montgomery Burns,But fortune ended up smiling on me while snuffing the life from my siblings.
C. Montgomery Burns,"My older brother was trampled by a horse, my sister died of a poisoned potato, my twin was shot, that girl was stabbed, he ate another poisoned potato, spontaneous combustion, fell down a well, potato, potato, and impaled on the Chrysler Building."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A word of caution, young Woosterfield: watch out for those closest to you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You don't know when they'll strike -- a boating accident, a mishap during a ""ski trip."" But rest assured one way or another they will do you in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, would you care to continue this conversation on the teeter-totter?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I told you, I only weigh as much as my clothes and keys!"
C. Montgomery Burns,You won't know how they'll strike -- a boating accident...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, my favorite week of the year -- sophisticated financial discussions with my fellow plutocrats."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take that, Ted Turner! In your face, founder of FaceBook!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I raise a million dollars... and to sweeten the pot, my assistant, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, they're hardly worth a Smithers, but we don't have all night. Can you beat nine high?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, let's see how my burly-bottomed ball-handlers are faring. Smithers, we're leading two to nothing! Run out the clock, boys. Run out the clock..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that man, and why isn't his enthusiasm being punished?"
C. Montgomery Burns,How odd. His money seems to have bought him happiness.
C. Montgomery Burns,"If you're really a billionaire, give me the secret billionaire's handshake. Smithers, turn away."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So tell me, why don't you recoil from the public like a normal billionaire?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Fun? Is that how it's pronounced? I've only seen it written.
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's time for this peacock to show his feathers. You know, the feathers with the big eye that trick them into thinking that's my front? Said feathers are what I'll flaunt!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silence! Now, let's make some noise for everyone's favorite basketball team, whom I have renamed the Springfield Excitement."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ladies, hold onto your husbands! It's time for the saucy antics of Springfield's own Basket-belles."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, enjoy your game and the madcap antics of the free-wheeling title-holder of this asset: me!"
C. Montgomery Burns,We have to turn this business around! Time to think outside the boxeola... what would Mark Cuban do?
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's it, men! Pave and tar the way God intended!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I can, I shall and in the future I will have done. I cannot be stopped!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent speech. Just excellent. I no longer wish to build my magnificent new basketball stadium.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nor will we have the chance to marvel at number one draft pick Muk Mu, the human North Pole."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I'm afraid he'll be on the first kayak back to Ketchikan."
C. Montgomery Burns,Welcome to the American dream: a billionaire using public funds to construct a private playground for the rich and powerful.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now, so our skybox owners can really enjoy the game, I shall let in the sky!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You've won this round. But when next we meet, the beekeeper will be the beekeepee!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"...so that's how I was outfoxed by a little girl and her half-wit companion. When my beautiful stadium was declared a bee sanctuary, and I had to take a third-quarter writedown of eight hundred four million dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait, wait, wait, it's only a matter of four million. I'm sure I can find that somewhere. I, uh, I have fifty dollars here in my wallet..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mark, can you get me off the hook -- for old times' sake?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Young man, you have the noble bearing of the barbarian leader Vercingetorix"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tell me, what student government office do you hold? Secretary? Treasurer? Dare I say Secretary-Treasurer?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hot dog! Say...how would you like to work for me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"7-G?! Let the Lennys and the Carls of the world waste their wretched lives in that testicle-shriveling torture chamber. Son, you'll be working in... Sector 6-F!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Pass. I've already lifted this thing once today. I'm not Hercules!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, well. If it isn't the Tardy Boys and Nancy Clueless."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I've known about the gem for years. You see, my dear girl, I joined the Freemasons before it was trendy. That's my eyeball on the dollar bill."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hence I trailed you on your quest, accompanied by my faithful albino."
C. Montgomery Burns,Then why do I give you all the albino holidays off? Hm? Hm?
C. Montgomery Burns,Fine. Then you unscramble those letters to spell out the location of the gem... while you two dig your own graves.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be interested in a mere bauble. Her greatest treasure would be a pure young girl. You are pure, aren't you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm... I don't really want you people inside, but you could dangle from the skids."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Back when I wrestled at Yale, I was in the lightest weight category -- ""ether weight."" Now, get ready to face the wrath of the ""New Haven Nuisance""!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, I expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In any event, much as what formerly was my kidney is now my heart, I've decided to promote from within. One of you will get the job. But which one?..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Congratulations! I dub thee King of the Morons, also known as Supervisor for Sector Seven-G. Here is your key to the executive washroom."
C. Montgomery Burns,Her shapely gams have finally persuaded me to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, although these days I can make neither haste nor waste. You know, Simpson -- this has truly been a lovely afternoon."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Until Mr. Roosevelt's New Deal starts working, this country's still in a depression. I'm spending a fortune on atoms, and we have to cut costs!"
C. Montgomery Burns,No! No! This is our year! How can this be happening?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Comparing me to old Draco, eh? I'll have to do something about this."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I imagine Cap City's been wooing you with trips to the seashore, a Christmas goose, Spanish lemons... folderol I can't afford to match. But please, accept this little going away present."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, but these aren't just any donuts. These donuts were made the old-fashioned way: the dough is sweetened with Cuban sugar from pre-Batista plantations, then it's deep fried in the tallow of three different animals, two of which are now extinct."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, if you stay on at the Springfield Nuclear Plant, you could have one of these tasty beauties every day."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sure, you can have a health plan... or, two donuts a day..."
C. Montgomery Burns,I feel like I'm mashing the tufty on the links at Saint Andrew's!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait, I'm shooting at Nazis? That's not how I remember it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Gentlemen, I'm afraid we've detected a small leak somewhere in the heavy water piping facility."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, indeed it is. Tonight I will be continuing my courtship of Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia."
C. Montgomery Burns,Tonight's the night I pop the question: where's the Kaiser's gold? Now get to work on that leak!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Colonel Burns? Why, I haven't heard my father's name in years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Surprised? Me, C. Montgomery Burns, locked up like an animal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'll tell you my tale... by thinking about it to myself."
C. Montgomery Burns,"...and so our Employee of the Month is the late Roger Ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. Moving on. The Power Plant's first annual Fourth of July picnic is this coming Saturday!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, I'm afraid you misunderstand. This picnic is for me. You will all be spending your Independence Day slaving away in the hot summer sun without pay, lotion or gratitude."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Spare ribs, eh? I've played a round of tenpins or two in my life, and to me, the word ""spare"" reeks of second best. Give me ten full frames of strike ribs!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And you, find my doctor and ask him why I'd ask for something as insane as strike ribs!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes. They should go. Just as soon as they perform this musical I've written in celebration of our nation's birth.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Grab your scripts, people! We open in twenty minutes! Break a leg!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"For God's sake, man, it's a figure of speech. You're fired!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, sound the alarum! Summon the shire reeve! Wake the beadle!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I... you see... it's just is it a crime to want nice things? And then to steal them from a public museum where any gum-chewing monkey in a Tufts University jacket can gawk at them? I think not!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"The entire town turned out to jeer me. Me, whose velvet breeches their lizard lips had so often joylessly smooched."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So ironic. After all my years of stock jobbing, gun running, attempted murder, successful murder, and tom peepery, they get me on a petty multi-million dollar art theft."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, until I am released, you shall be running the nuclear plant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Be strong, Smithers. Be strong for the plant. She needs you."
C. Montgomery Burns,This would've been a perfect time for it to start raining. Oh what the hell -- I'm telling this story!
C. Montgomery Burns,"That prison was like a prison to me. Not a prison of bricks and iron, but one of steel and cement. They took everything from me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... but a wealthy man can buy information, information that can be highly damaging to a certain warden."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well I'm sure the boys at the city desk would be interested to learn that you're addicted to... to...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Can't read my own writing. But I'll tell you this, warden, it starts with an ""H""..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Dartmouth?! Get me away from this hideous brute at once!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hm, looks like it's pledge day. Which jailhouse fraternity shall I join?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or one of these other dining clubs? Look at them circling me like I'm Cinderella, belle of the ball!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I feel it! I feel the love coursing through my vein!
C. Montgomery Burns,So that hellhole became my Heavenhole. I joined the prison choir...and the Prison Beatles Tribute Band.
C. Montgomery Burns,I raked a Zen garden in the courtyard...and found a peace and serenity I'd never known.
C. Montgomery Burns,Why would I want to leave the place where my soul was saved?
C. Montgomery Burns,"And that's where we came in. Now, without further ado, here's what happened next:"
C. Montgomery Burns,"But first, I'll daydream about a sport utility vehicle, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a wonderful blue pill."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, if I leave with you, they're just going to throw me back in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I had a little left between my toes. It quickly multiplied, and now I'm a bigger bastard than ever. But I must know -- what was it about me that made you try?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Farewell, friend. Maybe you'll find another lost lamb for your flock."
C. Montgomery Burns,I LIVE ME IN A MANSION / FULL OF THOSE GRECIAN URNS / BUT I'M LONELY ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY / THAT'S THE BLUES OF MONTY BURNS
C. Montgomery Burns,"OH, MY TAPESTRY'S MEDIEVAL, / MY HEART, IT'S EVIL TOO / BUT THAT DON'T MEAN I DON'T NEED LOVE / FROM LESSER TYPES LIKE YOU!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Did they jump on the pile to smoosh it down?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, just find the biggest idiot on our payroll and slip it in his bag."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I'd like thirty-seven snifters of your influenza syrup. One for me, one for Smithers here and the rest for my hounds."
C. Montgomery Burns,They'll see me take it and they'll want some. Yes 'oo will. Yes 'oo will. You little jelly belly.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahhh. I feel as hail and hearty as an eohippus.
C. Montgomery Burns,No. It's better that they hear it from me. I'll tell them the truth in the simplest way I know how.
C. Montgomery Burns,Good evening -- I have very sad news for all of you.
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm warning you! You are making a very powerful temporary enemy!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. I am well and truly hated. However, you will change your tune when you see the legacy I'm leaving behind me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm leaving all my money to an orchard that will grow inedible ""me""-shaped fruits."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I pay you, Smithers. And no kind of love can come from one man paying another."
C. Montgomery Burns,Shred them in the wood chipper and use the rags to wax my car.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I want to die quietly, on my own terms, crushing as many of those baby sea turtles as I possibly can."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers! Trading me in for a younger model, I see."
C. Montgomery Burns,And me smell like drugstore cologne the rest of the day? I don't think so. You may hug... my shadow.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silence, you sadistic monster! I've got my memory back, and I'm going to wreak a terrible vengeance. Taking an idea I got from a Stephen King book, I'm going to cover this town with a dome!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, what if I cover you all with... a cube of bulletproof plexi-glass!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! Loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! So yes, thank you, Springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, a carrier pigeon. Perhaps an update on the siege of Khartoum."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Do a ballet dance without no clothes on."" Bad grammar, but good advice."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, last night, I had a visit from three spirits..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I won't interrupt your holiday any longer. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good... pop star slash fashionista, Katy Perry?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I kissed a girl and I liked it! All is forgiven, Simpsons. Go and enjoy Ha-va-eee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course not! I want to sing the original, unabridged ""Thirty-Nine Days Of Christmas"". And a one and a two..."
C. Montgomery Burns,It is. I know it's hard to see a young buck like me and think of a day when I'm no longer in the pink.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, it always saddens me that you and Sheldon have never gotten along."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, you are the campiest of my aides du camp, but I'm afraid my true admiration is reserved for the self-made man. No Steve Woz-ni-ak thee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, not until you earn it. Until then, I will never see you as my equal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In case you didn't hear me, I said I will never see you as my equal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, a good old-fashioned lemon party! I call first squeeze!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I decided to hit the local nighteries with my trusted wingman.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, which of you wants to be the sliced haddock in a geezer sandwich?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, going down the checklist: feu allumÃ©...oui. Ballon gonflÃ©, oui."
C. Montgomery Burns,Gadzooks! The one hazard this balloon cannot negotiate -- a gentle breeze!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, your sharpened-shooting has saved my life! Name your reward. Anything -- just name it!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Pish tush! Wayne, as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery, I hereby award you the Springfield Nuclear Plant Silver Safety Hat!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I expect insolence, but rank insolence? Off with his job!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy."
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Although this millennium is still young, I feel it is time to award this giant trophy paid for with your healthcare cuts..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Indeed. That Homer Simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.
C. Montgomery Burns,I may have a use for this Simpson character higher up in the organization.
C. Montgomery Burns,"When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just give me your answer! And make it quick! Our current ""account man,"" Robert Marlowe here, is retiring at the end of the month."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. It means a hefty expense account and a corner office."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water."
C. Montgomery Burns,It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!"
C. Montgomery Burns,How ironic. I survived the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers and now this!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now they're all excellent choices, so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer and we'll elect him."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, no indeed! Now if I can just get my three million dollars back..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Can someone open this bottle of mother wolf placenta for me?
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's my cuddle bear! I loved him, I shot him, he's mine!"
C. Montgomery Burns,It has come to my attention that you lunch-bagging wage-lizards are robbing me blind!
C. Montgomery Burns,Only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... Homer Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Simpson, how is it that you alone manage to keep your moral compass pointed to true north?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hush! Now, while Simpson gets the day off, the rest of you will write thirty-page essays entitled ""Homer Simpson: Moral Lodestar."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"This Monday, the plant will be conducting physical examinations of all employees."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And don't forget, federal law mandates that we consider alcohol a drug."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is the last time I pay the price for the irritating mortality of the human worker! Smithers, it's time to re-staff with the super-intelligent kangaroos we've been breeding!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ladies and gentlemen, meet the future masters of the human race."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You fool! These are robots! You will train them, and they will replace you."
C. Montgomery Burns,I give you permission to shake your fists in anger twice.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I didn't say ""Monty says!"" Now I have cause to terminate!"
C. Montgomery Burns,So we need one meat sock on the payroll. But who?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, wait! As it turns out, there is one job available. But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, it looks like we've found this plant's one remaining worker of bone and sinew."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cheap power, plentiful jobs, and all your swimming holes shall be warm and bubbling."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now see here! You are so not the heartless automatons I was looking for! There's one thing man has that machines can never match: hounds!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Fine! Slink away! And guess what: all those times I said ""you're a good boy,"" it was a lie!"
C. Montgomery Burns,No! Stop! I'll give you the combination to the num-num safe!
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahh. The solarium. We'll be safely cornered in this glass room with one door.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I've learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor. You're all hired back... as temps!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. He's alive. Smithers, give this man one ibuprofen, uncoated, and send him back to his workstation."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, pish. When I was in Africa, I had my skull cracked open by cannibals, and I'm still kicking!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's right. I have his memories because I ate his brain."
C. Montgomery Burns,Unhand your Edison slate and bring your gold-brickery to a caesura!
C. Montgomery Burns,Nuclear energy was a craft before it was a science.
C. Montgomery Burns,"When uranium came from a stream...and atoms were split by hand...then transformed into the kind of electricity that illuminated not just our homes, but our souls as well?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Who decided that the electrons we produce can't stand for something greater?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sure, handmade electricity costs more and powers less... but maybe that's the point."
C. Montgomery Burns,"First inventor: you, bus driver! Give us the gist of your terrible idea!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Dammit! I guess it's time I explain, to these good people, the upcoming..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver. If you don't give the driver all the money, he'll drive you over a cliff. It's just common sense. Furthermore, rich people feel things more deeply than the common man."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well then let me just say this: Marco Rubio es un paÃ±uelo rosa!
C. Montgomery Burns,"To decide how much your electricity bills will rise, I've assembled a team of distinguished economists...and placed plausible rate hike percentages on their backs."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now we will use unfettered free market principles to arrive at a number. Release the hounds!
C. Montgomery Burns,Notice how the Keynesians climb trees while the Austrian school economists hide under rocks.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And there you have it, folks -- rates will rise a healthy seventeen percent. And now, to help you disperse..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hello Smithers! Fancy seeing you in Casual Encounter Park."
C. Montgomery Burns,Glamorous Godfrey was the most famous wrestler in the world! And you are he!
C. Montgomery Burns,"The world may have despised Glamorous Godfrey, but that conceited mother-puncher was my hero."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner in exchange for a few tales of the golden age of professional grappling."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, it looks like you've made a new fan. It'd be a shame to let him down..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't believe I'm on the town with Glamorous Godfrey himself! Tell me of your epic battle with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.
C. Montgomery Burns,What I wouldn't give to see Glamorous Godfrey in action once more!
C. Montgomery Burns,Would you ever consider throwing your wig back into the ring?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You've got it all wrong, my friend. Once you see it my way, you'll understand that being hated is the greatest feeling in the world."
C. Montgomery Burns,"IT'S A HIGH TO BE LOA-THED! / CHUCKY, STALIN, MEGATRON / ERIC CARTMAN, DONKEY KONG / VADER, NADER, SIMON LEGREE / TERMINATORS ONE, TWO AND THREE / IAGO, JOKER, VOLDEMORT / MCENROE ON CENTER COURT / MR. BURNS AND SKELETOR / KEEP YOUR GOOD GUYS, WHAT A SNORE"
C. Montgomery Burns,SO LISTEN UP BECAUSE I'M GIVING / THE BEST ADVICE YOU'LL EVER KNOW / SO FEEL THE THRILL / I KNOW YOU WILL / IT'S A HIGH TO BE LOA...THED!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, aficionados of the roped ring, to a thrilling night of senior-on-senior action."
C. Montgomery Burns,And now our main event. In this corner: Baby Face Palooka...
C. Montgomery Burns,"And entering the ring, America's original vainglorious bastard... Glamorous Godfrey!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, feel their hatred. It makes you strong, powerful... alive!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Fake? Ridiculous! If professional wrestling were fake... that would make every fan in the history of the sport a complete and utter moron.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, I've always had a keen eye for tiny talent."
C. Montgomery Burns,"In this corner, for truth and justice -- Captain Flag and Half-Mast."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now entering the ring, the first family of foul play: Glamorous Godfrey and Beautiful Bart!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"What are you doing, Godfrey! You're a villain, not some bullet-brained rail-splitter. Without someone to hate, there's no excitement, no thrill!"
C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you! I wrote a song for you! When am I ever going to use that again? Curse you and this morbidly obese little half-wit.
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at those eyes! There's an employee with a healthy case of the go-get-'ems!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at those delightful children, Smithers... all those healthy organs, ripe for the harvesting."
C. Montgomery Burns,I get a whiff of the immigrant from these newfangled superheroes.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm... reclusive millionaire, stately mansion, damaged psyche. He's just like me!"
C. Montgomery Burns,But I won't become just any bat -- I shall be the terrifying bat who swoops from the sky and sucks the vital essence of his prey. I shall be: Fruit-Bat-Man!
C. Montgomery Burns,"The police? Bah! Every last man on the take. And I should know, because I'm on the give."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I am the squeak in the rafters, the flutter in the chimney, the tiny teeth-marks in the peach... I am ""Fruit-Bat-Man!"" Now, back to my natural realm, the inky night!"
C. Montgomery Burns,You have to keep squeezing this thing?! Who has the strength for that?
C. Montgomery Burns,"A toast, to our enigmatic new protector -- who certainly isn't me! Smithers, wink my eye!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I hate to get all pruney, but heated tubbery is what we playboys do!"
C. Montgomery Burns,A civilian! She mustn't know I'm a hero! Gouge her eyes out!
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you get it?! I don't care who you are or what you want.
C. Montgomery Burns,"What do you mean ""actually?"" I've punched out four Homer Simpson-shaped burglars tonight alone."
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe I could wrap them around your gabby little throat!
C. Montgomery Burns,Your plan failed! Thank god this plant has never had a functioning air conditioner.
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's impossible! Smithers, didn't we move this plant to China?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"There isn't a prison made that can hold me! Prisons are still made of mud and wattles, right?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let this be a lesson to those who love cash, that your nice stash of cash could be gone in a flash. And if you are awful and nasty and cruel..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls a wagon with his bare tongue!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now... I must ask that small children leave, good women avert their eyes, and men take a stiff slug of circus whiskey... behold, the most hideous creature of all!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All of you! Get back out there with your flippers flapping, and your stumps a-stomping! Joe and Jane normal expect some entertainment for their nickel!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Enough! You will comport yourself with the dignity expected of a traveling freak show!
C. Montgomery Burns,"If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold."
C. Montgomery Burns,The girl that got away. She broke my first heart.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I had a spring in my step like that once, back when I met Lilah."
C. Montgomery Burns,Anything she wanted I was willing to do. Anything. Except...
C. Montgomery Burns,"It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Those raked rocks could've been me! Now since you're so good at finding things, find the exit!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well then, I should disrobe at once. Housekeeping! Send up a Chinese dressing screen! And one of Firestone's finest vulcanized prophylactics! Be right back."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! Which do I take first? The rhino horn or the tiger tongue?
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah! I'll just do it the old-fashioned way. With my pump.
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! Run down to Sears Roebuck and get a five-eighths inch Phillips head bolt!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Lilah, even at the end I waited too long. What if I give her the breath of life?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Hoo boy. I guess one regret just leads to another.
C. Montgomery Burns,"There you are, my good man. A little broth will cure your mental illness."
C. Montgomery Burns,You know what? I think I'll give it another five.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Here's the ""scoop."" You're our future so we can't afford to have you lose. And I love the Spanish, from the Inquisition to the delightful Franco years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No one says I can't buy a second grade election. Why, I had enough money to fix People Magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Most of the money went to convincing them that I was ""alive."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Right here! Now, Smithers. I want you to eat this for me, describe every taste, and don't forget the brain freeze!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"As of now, each of those nuclear nitwits is wearing a video camera -- with a direct feed to me."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers... how much did this company lose to office supply theft last year?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, no more of that... thanks to this twenty-six million dollar surveillance system! Beware, rabbits... I spy with my transplanted eyes! Oh, and I forgot to show you the best feature!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Each of these buttons represent an employee. When I press it, he or she dies."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. I won't disturb you again."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven."
C. Montgomery Burns,"From the Wisconsin Standees! Milk-fed, yet so slim. Permit me to play you a tune on my mouth organ."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome to Earth, local time is ten-thirty-seven, we know you have your choice of portals so thank you for choosing the Burns Hellport, a division of Gulf and Western."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome to the most frustrating, befuddling, and yes, erotic, book release party you've ever attended."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Indeed it is. ""Evergreen Terrace"" is built atop a massive shale deposit."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Think of it, all that poor natural gas, trapped underneath your shanties and lean-to's. Smithers, give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business."
C. Montgomery Burns,You haven't bested me! I will find a way to shatter that shale!
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute... I'm not having a stroke, am I?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in Evergreen Terrace. To win people over, I'll need a salesman whose folksy faÃ§ade masks a deep gusher of greed."
C. Montgomery Burns,Congratulations Simpson. You're now my Chief Energy Innovation Marketing Officer.
C. Montgomery Burns,All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bah! Fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make America independent of sheikhs, caliphs and... Scandinavians. Not to mention it doesn't create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Then say yes to this raise, this promotion, and this flannel shirt which says ""I'm not screwing you over!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Maxine, no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I have embarked on a ""beneficial friendship"" with a woman with whom I have nothing in common. Her opinions are abhorrent to me. But the passion... well, look at these racy texts she sends me."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm... Well then I must harden my heart against such an outcome.
C. Montgomery Burns,Hold on. This feels light. One of these deeds is missing a signature.
C. Montgomery Burns,The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,"""All I lost was money?"" Let me make one thing perfectly clear -- our dalliance meant nothing to me! You were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak, and now I cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon! Consider this ill-conceived affair terminated!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, you've come begging not to be fired? Smithers, turn my back on this man. Maximum huff!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Different, exactly. That's why I had to give my woman the old heave-ho."
C. Montgomery Burns,Not for one Chinese second! And I'm sure she's forgotten all about me.
C. Montgomery Burns,A project this bloated and ill thought-out could only be the work of an angry liberal... Maxine!
C. Montgomery Burns,My ex is using the thing I hate most against me... big government!
C. Montgomery Burns,You're just doing this to get back at me for dumping you!
C. Montgomery Burns,"If that woman thinks she's been scorned now, she ain't seen nothing yet..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What is he doing? He was furious at that woman, now he's embracing her. He told me himself they had nothing in common!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was a fool to break up with you, Maxine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"But we've got passion, and as long as we've got that, our lives will never get boring."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I wish we had bought the more expensive theater tickets. I'll never see anything in row ""BB""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why are all cars black or grey now? It's like if you see a red one, it's a big deal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Also, you will be visited by three spirits tonight. No, wait, that's my schedule. Smithers! We need to cancel the ten-thirty spirit!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Installing an M.H.D. Generator would allow the plant to operate at a higher temperature without the tyranny of moving parts. Using conducting plasma as the moving conductor...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent! Clearly the work of Lenny. That's the white one, right?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Henry Ford! Good to see you. As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Young man, I look at you and I see myself."
C. Montgomery Burns,My doctor says I'm not allowed to imagine. So I hired someone to do it for me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is wonderful, Smithers. For once in my life something's going my way."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was going to say ""get out,"" but your idea sounds better."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, friends. I've invited you here to share in our first quarterly profit report. I'm sure you're all eager to hear how much richer I am. Now, to end the suspense: Elon?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, the planet. I adore the planet. And do you know my favorite part of the planet? Gravity!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, all I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one. Why does God hate dreamers?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once-in-a-lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Your so-called ""savior"" isn't interested in saving anything but the world. Bah!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, the hounds feel terrible for what they did. And good news, one pooped out your ear! We'll dip it in iodine and it's just like new."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Also, I'm sorry I couldn't find the records of the shots the hounds had, which in turn led to all those painful injections in your abdomen."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've made the calls. I'm going to have Elon Musk killed. And I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend."
C. Montgomery Burns,Nonsense! Just because a man can't see or hold his hand steady doesn't make him any less of a marksman.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hey, swabby. You've missed spots there... and another one there... and there... Every other spot is begrimed!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Young man, how do you fit such brilliance into such an ugly ethnic head?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Interesting attitude for a janitor. What say we make you the new supervisor of Sector 7-G?!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, what profit a man if he gain the world and lose his soul. Seriously. I need an amount. In round dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, go ahead. And be careful with the Venus flytrap!"
C. Montgomery Burns,They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just lean into it. It'll be over soon, one way or another."
C. Montgomery Burns,"...after we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served..."
C. Montgomery Burns,...and upon leaving you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth. Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Curse that Elon Musk! Thanks to that Earth-smooching buttinski, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. All I have left are the clothes on my back and the clones in my freezer."
C. Montgomery Burns,I had to replace my beloved hounds with teacup poodles. It's pathetic. Watch. Release the hounds!
C. Montgomery Burns,But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes. I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll just have to sell everything and move to the South Pacific with you. What a grim fate that would be.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations."
C. Montgomery Burns,So my offer... for one ton of your uranium... is a goat.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... twelve goats."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm so sorry I pretended not to be gay for all those years. Better an old queen than never a queen at all.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Two now. Nineteen million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight on delivery."
C. Montgomery Burns,So the good King's cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power. Everyone wins.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word ""virgin?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello. I'm proud to announce that we have been able to increase safety...
C. Montgomery Burns,"... here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer, or affecting management pay raises. However, for you semi-skilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses."
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
C. Montgomery Burns,You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
C. Montgomery Burns,You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, please, please, don't fight. Just go out back and have a good time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Fire that man, Smithers. I don't want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes. And this must be your lovely wife... ... ""Marge."" And look at little... ... ""Lisa"". Why, she's growing like a weed. And this must be... ... ""Brat""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Musicians, cease that infernal tutlitating. ""Thank you all..."" ""...for coming."""
C. Montgomery Burns,But now it's time to say goodbye. Please get off my property until next year. I suggest you don't dawdle. The hounds will be released in ten minutes.
C. Montgomery Burns,Awww. That's the kind of family unity I like to see. Smithers...
C. Montgomery Burns,Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,I've never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent, excellent. Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'd like to see our self-styled Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just a second, Simpson! Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Of course! It's simplicity itself! I won't forget this, Simpson. Now return to your work, and tell no one of what transpired here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why you young ragamuffin. I was never one to back away from a snowball fight. Smithers, you may fire at will."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Morons! Pathetic morons in my employ, stealing my precious money. This is hopeless! None of these cretins deserve a promotion."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Hmmm. An unspoiled lump of clay to mold in my own image. Our new junior executive. Bring him to me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well those are my ideas! You people don't think, you regurgitate. That's why I promoted someone who's in touch with the workers. You!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmmm. Brilliant. Who could have ever imagined that Simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly?
C. Montgomery Burns,"My dear tired old Smithers, do I detect a note of jealousy?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hey ho, men. You know I was watching the DuMont last night and I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox. Now there's a man who could get things done."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know."
C. Montgomery Burns,What! Blast his hide to Hades! And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you very much, Professor Science! I know what dimoxinil is. Now go and make an example of this hooligan."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now, with some fresh insights, one of the rising young stars of our nuclear family, Homer Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hi, ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut. That is all."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you would find in any well-maintained nuclear facility? Or, for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table. Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room and hopefully, when we return the pile of money will be gone."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, well... a little dab of paint here, a little spackle there... how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that I had the strength to take it out on you, Smithers. Now please go. I would be alone."
C. Montgomery Burns,ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / MADE IT RUN / MADE IT RACE AGAINST TIME/ ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / NOW IT'S DONE / BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME./ HALF A MILLION BOOTS WENT SLOGGING THROUGH HELL / I WAS THE KID WITH THE DRUM.
C. Montgomery Burns,"HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / THEY CALLED ME AL / IT WAS AL ALL THE TIME / HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / I'M YOUR PAL / BUDDY, CAN'T YOU SPARE A DIME."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah. Excellent. This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. But, but how do we turn your average Joe Sixpack against Mary Bailey?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"-- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky."
C. Montgomery Burns,Many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation. Nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So... you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may, in fact, be a kind of super fish!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No. You see, friends... if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant, they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman."
C. Montgomery Burns,"The truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that can't be beat. Mmmm mmmm. So, to summarize: Say what you want about me. I can take the slings and arrows. But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky. Good night and God bless."
C. Montgomery Burns,We're gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the State Capital!
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh. I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this God-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day!
C. Montgomery Burns,Only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Homer. Marge, you look dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course. A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite."
C. Montgomery Burns,Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Homer, I agree with you and, if I'm elected governor , I will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the State capital like it or not."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Lisa, do you have a question you would like to ask your Uncle Montgomery?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oooh, a tough question, but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity. Others are more impressed with my incorruptibility... still others by my determination to lower taxes, and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You must have a few tricks left up your sleeves. Smithers, boil some coffee. We're not licked yet."
C. Montgomery Burns,Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns,"She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ironic, isn't it Smithers? This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, take your mind off contaminates for one night and have a hot dog."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Huh? Hmmm, oh, oh yes... Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and uh, ""Expecting""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the ""trouble ball"" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?"
C. Montgomery Burns,My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Unfortunately, Homer Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening. I want him banned for life from all company outings."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmmm, delicious. Smithers, every year you outstrip yourself in succulence."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, no! I couldn't eat another bite. Dispose of all this. I did, however, save room for your special pumpkin pie."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, for crying out loud... Just give him a nickel and let's get going."
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes. My attorneys have advised me to pay you for running over your child. So I'm cutting you a check.
C. Montgomery Burns,"... One... Hundred... Dollars! Of course you'll have to sign a waiver, relinquishing your right to sue and so forth... merely a formality..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup."
C. Montgomery Burns,A million dollars! Smithers! I want this Homer J. Simpson fired!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well... all right, then. I don't want to seem like an ogre. I'll bide my time. Let him twist in the wind... slowly... slowly. And then... when the papers have found their new ""flavor of the month"", he'll find out this cat has claws!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Certainly. Oh, it was a beautiful day. The sun was shining. I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Suddenly, that incorrigible Simpson boy, darted in front of me..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why you despicable, cold-blooded monster. Regardless of what you think, we must summon help, and comfort the dear boy until an ambulance arrives."
C. Montgomery Burns,What are you looking at me like that for? You believed his cock and bull story.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yeah, settlement? Fine! Hang your heads in shame, you over-priced, under-brained, glorified notary publics! Just get that big ape to my house tonight and we'll buy him off with a banana or two."
C. Montgomery Burns,...and that ugly customer was the last Indonesian Rhino on earth.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I don't like everything about them, just their heads. Well, would you care for some wine, old buddy?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bottoms up Simpson, there's plenty more where that came from."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Now then, Homer, old chum, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What do you say, we settle this man to man?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, no, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, check out the luscious pair on that red-head. That's it, baby. Work those ankles."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? I want him in my office at nine o'clock Monday morning. We'll see who eats whose shorts!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs. Tatum II, I'd even go to an employee's house. Oh, I can picture it now. The screen door rusting off its filthy hinges. Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die."
C. Montgomery Burns,We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
C. Montgomery Burns,"The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mr. Simpson, I dread the day when a hundred thousand dollars isn't worth groveling for."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Smithers, I guess that's what you call your ""artistic temperament""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking? Mrs. Simpson, this commission and all its glory can be yours, but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, yes! Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"If you'll excuse me, I'm changing for a board meeting."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari."
C. Montgomery Burns,Thank goodness. Another day in this suburban nightmare and I would've needed half a white valium. Thank you for your gracious hospitality. See you at the unveiling.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia."
