Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, Bart, we'll find something fun for you to do."
Seymour Skinner,Ah! Here we are! Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it."
Seymour Skinner,"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
Seymour Skinner,"You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... Well there's still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don't you tell your teacher I let you go home early."
Seymour Skinner,I don't have an appointment with any large men --
Seymour Skinner,"I'm PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors?"
Seymour Skinner,"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
Seymour Skinner,I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said.
Seymour Skinner,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
Seymour Skinner,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
Seymour Skinner,"I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself."
Seymour Skinner,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
Seymour Skinner,"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."
Seymour Skinner,"I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom."
Seymour Skinner,They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now?
Seymour Skinner,"Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one's for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire.."
Seymour Skinner,"One... more... time! HELLO MA BABY... HELLO MA HONEY... HELLO MY RAGTIME GAL. DOUBLETIME, NOW. SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE..."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding."
Seymour Skinner,"Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year."
Seymour Skinner,"Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we've ever had. I really do. And now, here's Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices."
Seymour Skinner,That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention.
Seymour Skinner,"This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."""
Seymour Skinner,Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.
Seymour Skinner,"Now, boys and girls, let's welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company."
Seymour Skinner,People... people... Allllll right. You know I can wait just as long as you. Knock it off!
Seymour Skinner,No. Mmm... careful now...ooh... gee that one grazed my ear...
Seymour Skinner,"I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school!"
Seymour Skinner,Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy?
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I can't be everywhere at once."
Seymour Skinner,"Look, let's can the euphemisms, huh? No more bullspit. How would you like to be a hall monitor?"
Seymour Skinner,"I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against?"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock."
Seymour Skinner,"Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court..."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Who's behind this monstrous crime?"
Seymour Skinner,"I've been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor."
Seymour Skinner,"D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention."
Seymour Skinner,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
Seymour Skinner,"And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets."
Seymour Skinner,"One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay."
Seymour Skinner,I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it.
Seymour Skinner,Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.
Seymour Skinner,"HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! HA HA!"
Seymour Skinner,Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
Seymour Skinner,Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
Seymour Skinner,Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade."
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
Seymour Skinner,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention, everyone. This is Principal Skinner. I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction."
Seymour Skinner,Somebody put a torch to these permanent records! Quickly now.
Seymour Skinner,Attention students: please clear out your lockers into the waste baskets provided.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm, I haven't seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon. Well, William, another school year gone by."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, back to work then. Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing. We want the old girls sparkling when I get back."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, so did you. You got an ex-Green Beret mad."
Seymour Skinner,"Now in a moment, we'll be raffling off our grand prize..."
Seymour Skinner,"But first, our second-prize winner, and the recipient of this handsome shoe buffer....... Ned Flanders!"
Seymour Skinner,And the winner of the blimp ride is... Homer Simpson!
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, you've been flushing for twenty minutes. Is there a problem?"
Seymour Skinner,"We won't miss a minute of school, thanks to your father."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, we'll do anything you want. Just call off your giant mechanical ants!"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I know I can trust you to inventory this Glee Club peanut brittle."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, I've gotta slash 40 percent out of the budget."
Seymour Skinner,"Listen to your mother, Lisa. I owe everything I have to my mother's watchful eye... and swift hand."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, there's mother now. Watching me. What's that, mother? They have a right to be here. It's school business. I... Mother, that sailor suit doesn't fit anymore!"
Seymour Skinner,"Some student -- possibly Bart Simpson -- has been circulating candy hearts featuring crude, off-color sentiments. Well let me tell you something, Valentine's Day is no joke..."
Seymour Skinner,"This orange drink is the only way to recoup our terrible losses from ""Fire Drill Follies."" I just don't know what went wrong."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. So mother was right -- it was my fault. Go ahead, water it down some more."
Seymour Skinner,"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a wonderful evening of theater and picking up after yourselves."
Seymour Skinner,... with a thorough re-telling of the life of George Washington.
Seymour Skinner,"Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair."
Seymour Skinner,"Over, under, in and out, that's what shoe tying's all about."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don't think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize!"
Seymour Skinner,"Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, we've just been tipped off that Superintendent Chalmers is planning a surprise inspection. So let's clean up this pigsty!"
Seymour Skinner,"On another topic, the following students have won mountain bikes: Bart Simpson..."
Seymour Skinner,You may pick the bikes up in Utility Basement B.
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen. You're being swept under the rug for the Superintendent's visit. Enjoy!"
Seymour Skinner,Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key?
Seymour Skinner,So what's the word down at One School Board Plaza?
Seymour Skinner,They were the children's idea. I tried to stop them.
Seymour Skinner,"May I interest you in a Jello brick, Sir? There's a grape in the center."
Seymour Skinner,You're not made of stone... a brick and you're... made of stone...
Seymour Skinner,Well let's pick one at random. How about that one?
Seymour Skinner,No he said what's that rattle. It's about the heating duct.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you know what they say, sir. ""Where there's no smoke, there's no fire."""
Seymour Skinner,"There's no detention this time, Simpson. This is the end. You are expelled from Springfield Elementary!"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm very impressed at the independent learning you've displayed here."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Anyway, as a reward for your studying, I've decided to welcome you back to our school. You'll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, Dol... Oh dear God!"
Seymour Skinner,"Then we ride these bikes to Mexico -- and freedom, Willie! Freedom!"
Seymour Skinner,"Mother, get an extra-special hug ready. I've bought you a new juicer!"
Seymour Skinner,Good Lord! Flu germs entering every orifice in my head.
Seymour Skinner,"""Prisoner 24601""... Why, I wore this for two years in a Viet Cong internment center. Never thought I'd see the old girl again."
Seymour Skinner,Only one question remains gentlemen. What do we call ourselves?
Seymour Skinner,"We need a name that's witty at first, but that seems less funny each time you hear it."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, he's with his new girlfriend. The Japanese conceptual artist."
Seymour Skinner,"Gentlemen, US Magazine just came out with its ""What's Hot and What's Not Issue."""
Seymour Skinner,"Well William, I'm back. So, how did you spend your summer?"
Seymour Skinner,I can't remember the last time we were all together.
Seymour Skinner,"Hey, everybody. Let's go sing at the hospital! FOR WE'VE GOT..."
Seymour Skinner,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."
Seymour Skinner,"Now I've gotten word that a child is using his imagination, and I've come to put a stop to it."
Seymour Skinner,The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for the rules.
Seymour Skinner,"Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man. Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I'm a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!!"
Seymour Skinner,"What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, I uh hesitate to bring this up, but a number of cities have rejuvenated their economies with uh, legalized gambling."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, there is an added bonus -- some of the revenue can go to help our under-funded public schools!"
Seymour Skinner,"And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no help from their parents, Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum."
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, Edna, everyone. Now class... I wonder who among you can tell me what this is?"
Seymour Skinner,"Class, instead of going to the box factory, today we'll be going to the... box factory."
Seymour Skinner,I'll handle this. Simpson! I'm giving you 'til the count of three to come out. One... two... three. I've done all I can do.
Seymour Skinner,Now wait just a minute. That wasn't discussed with me.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?"
Seymour Skinner,Well why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
Seymour Skinner,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""
Seymour Skinner,"Children, teachers, back to your rooms! Uh-oh, whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups. Ooh, right on cue."
Seymour Skinner,"Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, really I hardly think the children's appearance should --"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, let's see. Tide, Cheer, Bold, Biz, Fab, All, Gain, Wisk. I believe today I will try... Bold."
Seymour Skinner,"It was? Well, then we should get together again! Uh, say Saturday, at my house. Do you know where I live?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm, a flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it."
Seymour Skinner,"That's not true. I can buy a new pair. No, I can't. I needed those. I really did."
Seymour Skinner,Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam. I was their Sergeant, they were my loyal troops."
Seymour Skinner,"That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake."
Seymour Skinner,Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, that place must be falling apart. Oh, mercy. Nobody's mentioned me, have they?"
Seymour Skinner,"I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, Luigi, I'd like one with two seats. I'll be dining with a friend tonight."
Seymour Skinner,"""Dear Bart, your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten. However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. Seymour Skinner."""
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit."
Seymour Skinner,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where did you pick up that filth?!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company. You're in this man's army to learn!"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, I must admit, I do miss the school. And uh, frankly, the Army isn't quite as I remembered it."
Seymour Skinner,"Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it. I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired."
Seymour Skinner,"...Yes. Now you realize, if I become Principal again, we can no longer be friends. Unless you become a good student."
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah, well one question remains. How do I get out of the army?"
Seymour Skinner,"Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. Jaffee, spit out that gum."
Seymour Skinner,"""Please excuse my handwriting. I busted whichever hand it is I write with. Signed, Mrs. Simpson."" You were right to be suspicious, Edna. To the crime lab."
Seymour Skinner,I wish more students had agreed to these electronic tracking implants. We only had one volunteer.
Seymour Skinner,We did not! Now where's Bart? You better tell me!
Seymour Skinner,If I were a truant boy out for a good time I'd be right here. The Springfield Natural History Museum.
Seymour Skinner,"Why, there are no children here at the Four 'H' Club either! Am I so out of touch? No. It's the children who are wrong."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, I'll double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School."
Seymour Skinner,"I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say."
Seymour Skinner,I can't wait 'til the sentencing part. That's where I really shine.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, for the heinous crime of hooky, I sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria."
Seymour Skinner,"If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world."
Seymour Skinner,"A conjunction meaning ""in the event that"" or ""on condition that."""
Seymour Skinner,"Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, we're kind of like the original ""Odd Couple."" You're the messy one and I'm..."
Seymour Skinner,"I knew it! I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm a small man in some ways, Bart. A small, petty man. Three months detention."
Seymour Skinner,I hardly think it's fair to be charged full price. I'm up to my knees in the original cast of M*A*S*H.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, well, as a matter of fact, my refrigerator wasn't running. You spared me quite a bit of spoilage. Thank you, anonymous young man."
Seymour Skinner,"Door to door sugar? What a marvelous idea! What's that, mother? I'm just talking to the sugar man. Mother, I'm a big boy. I can do as I wish. Excuse me."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Diorama-rama. My favorite school event next to Hearing Test Thursday."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes. Very good wrath. Ah, let's see, our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Eh... But this is just an empty box!"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!"
Seymour Skinner,"Mm, I can't wait to see this. Be ready with the ribbon."
Seymour Skinner,"Allison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh is that so, young lady? Well, where is this phantom diorama?"
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl. You're only compounding your folly by lying about it."
Seymour Skinner,"Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, well, that changes everything. Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh. A little sterile... no real insight. What do you think, Miss Hoover?"
Seymour Skinner,"This has been a very disappointing day. All right, on to Lisa Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh noW, we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry."
Seymour Skinner,"Prepackaged ""Star Wars"" characters still in their display box?! Are those the limited edition action figures?"
Seymour Skinner,"Why, it's Luke, and Obie-Wan... and my favorite, Chewie. They're all here! What do you think?"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten."
Seymour Skinner,"Over here, Simpson! The detention room is dangerously overcrowded, so you'll be serving your time in the cafeteria."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, you should have thought of that before you made that paper airplane."
Seymour Skinner,This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable behavior.
Seymour Skinner,Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were some sort of common solution to both our problems?
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. Uh, Jimbo, why don't you ""assist"" Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day?"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that."
Seymour Skinner,"Easy there, young man. You'll only make yourself tired and stringy."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes... I believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating your shorts."
Seymour Skinner,"Congratulations, Simpson. You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months detention. There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention. This is Principal Skinner, your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. Dammit I wish we hadn't let the students name that one."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, the times, they are a-becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all time low. So I've come up with these ""Academic Alerts."" You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. This way, your parents won't have to wait until report card time to punish you."
Seymour Skinner,"Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography, and math. But ah, you're doing quite well in Home-Ec."
Seymour Skinner,"Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother."
Seymour Skinner,The Grand Exalted Leader requests a moment of your time. Class dismissed.
Seymour Skinner,"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
Seymour Skinner,"Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. Release the balloon."
Seymour Skinner,Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions!
Seymour Skinner,It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen! Now to find out who did this.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm... blueprints of the dummy, ... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner: ""Buttzilla."""
Seymour Skinner,"I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time."
Seymour Skinner,"Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men."
Seymour Skinner,Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.
Seymour Skinner,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
Seymour Skinner,"Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting."
Seymour Skinner,"Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-three minutes declination... No sighting."
Seymour Skinner,"Six hours, nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees fifty-eight minutes declination... No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?"
Seymour Skinner,"No, no there's no need for that... it's already named after me."
Seymour Skinner,"It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work."
Seymour Skinner,I've got it! What are you doing? Give me that phone.
Seymour Skinner,"Attention students. It's time once again to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's all prove how adult we can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner. Even though it's first-come first-serve, and the most popular sports fill up fast."
Seymour Skinner,"There is only one class left, but it happens to be the ""coolest"" one of all."
Seymour Skinner,You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
Seymour Skinner,Mm hm. We even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
Seymour Skinner,I'm telling you people the earth revolves around the sun.
Seymour Skinner,We've been invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level.
Seymour Skinner,It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on dates.
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, the battlefield is just a half mile ahead. Begin braking procedure!"
Seymour Skinner,"Otto, why don't you get some more gas. Here's the 'credit card.'"
Seymour Skinner,"Bu..but we don't have that kind of money. In fact, no school could afford to..."
Seymour Skinner,"He thinks he's so hot ever since he swept the ""princi"" awards. Those things are rigged."
Seymour Skinner,"Posh. Shredded newspapers add much needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, c'mon, Edna. We both know these children have no future."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, the kids have to learn about Tek War sooner or later."
Seymour Skinner,"We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention. This is an emergency broadcast. All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total -- Hey, gimme that."
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes."
Seymour Skinner,"Well children, I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold?"
Seymour Skinner,"Me? Go to my office? It's highly irregular, but all right..."
Seymour Skinner,"Let us out, Bart! / This is not funny, come on! / Bart, let us out right now!"
Seymour Skinner,"Come on! Or you are going to be very, very sorry."
Seymour Skinner,What's the point? There's no more money. Unless you've got some magic new source of revenue.
Seymour Skinner,This was a great way to make extra money. Renting out our cloakrooms to the overcrowded prison system.
Seymour Skinner,And as a bonus some of our more troublesome students might be scared straight.
Seymour Skinner,"Superintendant Chalmers, I'd like you to meet our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, in many cases the floor is the best... oh look! Here comes Lumpy, the school snake!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their appendixes removed. So without further ado, I give you the remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra."
Seymour Skinner,They will be playing Stars and Stripes Forever -- hopefully not forever.
Seymour Skinner,"I didn't burn down the school. It was the butterfly, I tell you! The butterfly!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that ""someone"" had slashed the pillow."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?"
Seymour Skinner,Ahh. Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Now, to re-direct our conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this oil money."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh mercy. Seriously though, before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and faculty have a few suggestions..."
Seymour Skinner,"That's odd. I don't have a secretary, or an intercom. But send him in."
Seymour Skinner,It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
Seymour Skinner,"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
Seymour Skinner,"Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well."
Seymour Skinner,"Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and his slant- drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.
Seymour Skinner,"In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music..."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh yes. But, anything else he tells you is a filthy lie."
Seymour Skinner,"Students, I have an announcement. One of your favorite comic book heroes, Radio Man..."
Seymour Skinner,"Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that. Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield."
Seymour Skinner,And they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster to play Fallout Boy.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, and the air conditioner will be fixed this afternoon."
Seymour Skinner,What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in scalpel hygiene?
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson, report to the principal's office for head lice inspection."
Seymour Skinner,Sweet Georgia Brown! Something is rotten at the Simpson house.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh-oh. Two independent thought alarms in one day. The students are over stimulated. Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms."
Seymour Skinner,"Good morning class. A certain agitator -- for privacy's sake let's call her Lisa S. -- No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson -- has raised questions about certain school policies. So in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film."
Seymour Skinner,"Now as a special treat courtesy of our friends at the Meat Council, please help yourselves to this tripe."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation. There's no mystery about Willie. Why, he simply disappeared... Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up."
Seymour Skinner,Wheel him out quietly. It's best the children don't see him.
Seymour Skinner,...Recharge fire extinguishers. This is a free service of the fire department.
Seymour Skinner,"As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't've come at a better time."
Seymour Skinner,"The year was 1968. We were on re-con in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan, ""UP WITH MINI-SKIRTS."" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it."
Seymour Skinner,"But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed ""Charlie"" to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right..."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... Oh. I'm going to have to think about that. Meanwhile, wear this home."
Seymour Skinner,"Several days ago, a violent riot erupted, incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan."
Seymour Skinner,No! No! Now don't try to remember what that slogan was.
Seymour Skinner,"To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated, I have decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms."
Seymour Skinner,"All right. Pick your size, extra-small or extra-large. We've got both. No pushing now... I... What?... Oh. I've just been informed we've run out of extra-large."
Seymour Skinner,"Ahhh, these uniforms are a godsend. Horseplay is down 40 percent. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half, and high spirits are at an all-time low."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it is starting to rain, but I can hardly be blamed for that, can I?"
Seymour Skinner,I don't understand it. I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses. Good Lord! Mother's in the park!
Seymour Skinner,"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
Seymour Skinner,What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward moment.
Seymour Skinner,"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Spring Break in Hong Kong. Custom-made suits at slave-labor prices..."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm afraid there are some problems with my tickets. I asked for a center seat, not an aisle seat. I specifically requested not to have the kosher meal. And I booked the flight leaving Saturday morning, not Friday morning!"
Seymour Skinner,"G.M. Chrysler!! I can't afford that! But I can't close the school a day early just to suit my vacation. Or can I? Think, Seymour, think..."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, Go to Work with Your Parents Day! Tomorrow, you will learn by doing and apply your knowledge of fractions and gym to real-world situations!"
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon."
Seymour Skinner,"But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ooh, delightfully devilish, Seymour."
Seymour Skinner,Superintendent! I was just... eh... stretching my calves on the windowsill! Isometric exercise. Care to join me?
Seymour Skinner,"Ah... oh, that isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no. I said ""steamed hams."" That's what I call hamburgers."
Seymour Skinner,Y... you know... one thing I sho... Excuse me for one second.
Seymour Skinner,"Ahh. Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped."
Seymour Skinner,"Young man, the only thing we exchanged for you is our national dignity."
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, please. The children want to pick on someone their own size."
Seymour Skinner,"First rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more impressive than Martin's milk carton ukulele. Willie, you can throw out the other projects, we have a winner!"
Seymour Skinner,"This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?"
Seymour Skinner,"That's true, but I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh... oh, good. This will sound crazy but at first I... I thought I'd enraged you again."
Seymour Skinner,"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
Seymour Skinner,"Sir, if you'll just stop yelling at me, I'm sure I can find a replacement..."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, yes. Uh, take a good look at him, Nelson, cause that's where you're headed."
Seymour Skinner,"After you claim your stolen merchandise, go directly to Mr. Muntz for an apology."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, you think this stolen 'H' is a laugh riot, don't you? Well, I'll tell you something that's not so funny: right now, Superintendent Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl!"
Seymour Skinner,"I guess it is a little funny... Nonetheless, I will find the culprit. We'll start with, oh, I don't know... Bart Simpson!"
Seymour Skinner,Balderdash. I'll just stick my head right in and --
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that would be the complete dozen... All right. Rather than tempt fate, I'll move along now."
Seymour Skinner,So we reach the bottom of the barrel: Nelson Muntz.
Seymour Skinner,"The cold, hard process of elimination places the 'H' squarely in your locker!"
Seymour Skinner,"A principal's ransom in stolen goods! Well sir, who's ""haw-hawing"" now, hmm?"
Seymour Skinner,"First, you're going to give back everything you've stolen, then I'm sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work known to man: janitorial work."
Seymour Skinner,Who's out there? Give me your names so I can tell the police!
Seymour Skinner,"Go back to bed, Mother! I've got it under control. Listen, you crumb-bums, if you think I'm impressed, I am not!"
Seymour Skinner,"I... ah, brandishing your buttocks is only getting me angrier!"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
Seymour Skinner,"Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale."
Seymour Skinner,"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this party is certainly a break in my routine. You know, normally I spend my Saturdays carefully laying out my clothes for the following week, and then I stroll down to the car wash to see if Gus is there..."
Seymour Skinner,Huh. I think we both know the answer to that... a lucky boy.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh? Well, I've always admired your tart honesty and ability to be personally offended by broad social trends."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, Bart... son... I don't know what you think you saw, but, uh, let me assure you..."
Seymour Skinner,And there are those who might try to use it against us for their own advantage.
Seymour Skinner,"Like you for... Bart, if life has taught me one lesson repeatedly, it's to know when I'm beaten. Let's talk deal."
Seymour Skinner,"What do you say, son? You keep our secret and some other student can inherit your gloomy, windblown future."
Seymour Skinner,Mmmm. This dessert is exquisite. What do you call it?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, of course. I'm sorry, I... I don't get out to restaurants much."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, I always thought I'd fall for a woman just like Mother... even though I didn't want to. And now that I haven't, I've discovered what true happiness can be, Edna."
Seymour Skinner,I'm afraid I already swallowed it while you were talking.
Seymour Skinner,"Good morning, students. Way to go there, Wendell. There's Ralph -- he knows the score. Jimbo, how's that hat today? Janey, Janey, bo-faney!"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, so good to see you! I have a little favor to ask you."
Seymour Skinner,I'd like you to give this note to Edna when you get back to class. I don't think I have to tell you it's for her eyes only.
Seymour Skinner,"No. It went just as we planned, except they confiscated my thermos of cola at the door."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, why, we're... We're, uh, on a... a, uh Uh, uh, what do you call... uh, field trip."
Seymour Skinner,"I'll... I'll... I'll go get him right now. Car keys, car keys, car keys."
Seymour Skinner,"Mother doesn't approve of me dating, so I need you to keep her busy for a few hours while Edna and I sneak out."
Seymour Skinner,"Mrs. Krabappel, Bart has something he wants to say to you."
Seymour Skinner,"Well... I'm sorry, but, ah, I can't give up the woman I love."
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm-hmm, it's Mr. Skinner now. I'm just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I don't know what we'll do without you. Well, so long."
Seymour Skinner,"I... No, wait! We're not going anywhere. I'm going to do what Bart should have told me to do a long time ago!"
Seymour Skinner,"Attention, Springfield. We have barricaded ourselves in the school and are not coming down until our demands are met."
Seymour Skinner,We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated and you acknowledge and celebrate our love.
Seymour Skinner,"I'm going to go out there, and tell every man, woman and child that I love Edna Krabappel."
Seymour Skinner,"It was a good idea, Bart. But it's just not working."
Seymour Skinner,"This is absurd. I did not have relations in that closet. And the fact is, I haven't... ...uh..."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, everyone, the fact is: I haven't ever had relations. I am a virgin."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh -- Hold on, Bart. May we have a word with you?"
Seymour Skinner,"We can't continue on like this, trying to build a private relationship in public -- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb."
Seymour Skinner,"That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them."
Seymour Skinner,"What a load of garbage! I'm ecstatic. With the money from this, we're within striking distance of our trip to Albany."
Seymour Skinner,"Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker -- I know he can teach us a lot about business -- Mr. C. Montgomery Burns!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm going to take advantage of this rare opportunity, even if you children aren't interested. Uh... Which do you think is more important: hard work or stick-to-it-iveness?"
Seymour Skinner,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, kids, the trip to Albany is off, and there's to be no more recycling."
Seymour Skinner,"Reverend, this is Principal Skinner. I'm facing a crisis and I didn't know to whom to turn."
Seymour Skinner,"Mother's gone too far. She's put cardboard over her half of the television. We rented ""Man Without a Face"" -- I didn't even know he had a problem. What should I do?"
Seymour Skinner,"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here in the mean streets of ""N'Awlins."" Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield, but in my heart I... I've always been a small-time hustler."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. Looks like you've already got an enemy, Chief. Y'know, folks 'round here don't much care for law and order types."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."
Seymour Skinner,"Lucky for you, this was just a warning gator. The next one won't be corked."
Seymour Skinner,"Big Daddy's trademark calling card. See, it's right here inside the skull."
Seymour Skinner,"Eh, it's not really a party town. Though if I remember correctly, they occasionally hold a function called Mardi... something."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, it's not rented, Chief -- it's stolen. That's the Louisiana Governor's mansion. It's been missing for eight months."
Seymour Skinner,"Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation..."
Seymour Skinner,"Seven o'clock Friday night, Mother. Time for our weekly silhouette."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, but you love silhouette night! And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions and -- Mother, why are you all dressed up?"
Seymour Skinner,"Why are we stopping at my school, Mother? What does it say on that sign?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"No...No he's, he's not crazy. It's true: I'm, I'm an impostor. That man is the real Seymour Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
Seymour Skinner,"Well, obviously it isn't. My real name is Armin Tamzarian."
Seymour Skinner,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals..."
Seymour Skinner,"...Miss Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments and unguents...and Jimbo, the school bully who will administer noogies and nipple twisters."
Seymour Skinner,"Young man, I can assure you my posterior is nothing more than flesh, bone, and that metal plate I got in 'Nam."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, I want you to knock off that potty talk right now."
Seymour Skinner,"You listen to me, son. You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say?"
Seymour Skinner,Attention. All honor students will be rewarded with a trip to an archeological dig!
Seymour Skinner,"Conversely, all detention students will be punished with a trip to an archeological dig."
Seymour Skinner,"I must admit, it is rather exciting. And -- Why, look -- here's something right here!"
Seymour Skinner,"It appears to be some sort of rock. I-- Oh, no, it's just a clump of dirt. Even so, my heart is pounding like a kettle drum. I'd better sit down for a moment."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this was a big bust. Come on, kids. Let's go home to our mothers."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup, you read my mind. Just, uh, give me twenty minutes, or so, to finish these tardy slips."
Seymour Skinner,My high school sweetheart was killed in a drag racing accident.
Seymour Skinner,"All right, Simpson, be honest with me. Is it actually possible to win this game?"
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, delegates. You leave tomorrow for the statewide model U.N., so this is our last chance to bone up. And bone we will."
Seymour Skinner,"Smile more... Work that pelvis... No, too much smile... Sit down."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, no, no, no. Young man, you need to do some serious boning."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, I'd like to, but I'm afraid he has diplomatic immunity."
Seymour Skinner,"Order, order! Do you kids want to be like the real U.N., or do you just want to squabble and waste time?"
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, kids. Otto's in charge. Remember, Otto, we're trusting you with our greatest natural resource, the school bus."
Seymour Skinner,"It's my allowance, Mother, and I'll burn it the way I want."
Seymour Skinner,"We have a very special visitor today. But he's no ordinary visitor. In fact, uh, you might say..."
Seymour Skinner,"Young man, the school dress code specifically forbids the wearing of earrings... unless you're of gypsy extraction."
Seymour Skinner,"Nuh-uh, that's a vampire! But, uh, they're also covered. Carry on."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, I'll be frank. In the event of nuclear war, we can only save our best and brightest."
Seymour Skinner,"Therefore, space in the fallout shelter will be reserved for Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince, our championship kickball team, and Sherri, but not Terri."
Seymour Skinner,"Ohh, Edna, you're certainly looking lovely tonight. Is that a new green sweater?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, Channel 6 is launching a children's news program. And they've asked me to select an outstanding student to be anchorchild."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmf. All right, if you're so smart, tell me who I selected to be lunch room monitor."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention, please. I need a volunteer for a thankless chore."
Seymour Skinner,"Shall I assume the only hand in the air is Lisa Simpson's? Thank you, Lisa."
Seymour Skinner,"We have a new student, Lisa. And I want you to show her the works. The lunchroom, the tree..."
Seymour Skinner,"But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock 'n bull story. They're out for cleaning, or whatever."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, I see the trophies are still out for cleaning. Eh, Lisa?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Lisa, I was hoping I could count on you again to spearhead our annual school-wide apple-pick."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, uh, we've never had a dance before. Lisa, you'd be doing all the work. What do you think?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I have to run home. I need you to keep an eye on the dance."
Seymour Skinner,"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, uh, people, there's been some confusion about our bird-sighting rules. You cannot count birds that you've seen at the zoo, on stamps, or in dreams."
Seymour Skinner,"Good heavens! I'm very glad you brought those in, Bart."
Seymour Skinner,I'll just get those killed and you can be on your way.
Seymour Skinner,"Mm-hm. It's a vicious ovoraptor. It feasts on bird eggs, and lays its own eggs in the nest. The unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch and devour her, too."
Seymour Skinner,"It's already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the NeNe. And it has nasty plans for the booby, the titmouse, the woodcock, and the titpecker."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, the one thing that mystifies me is how a Bolivian lizard made it to Springfield."
Seymour Skinner,"No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this: they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible."
Seymour Skinner,All right. I'll give you a moment. That will give us time to prepare for the splatter.
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, that's exactly one moment. It-- Oh my God, he's getting away!"
Seymour Skinner,You're still in the way. You don't seem to be moving at all.
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, Bart. This is where it ends. Relinquish the lizards."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I hope you're happy, Bart. You have no idea what kind of plague you've unleashed upon this town."
Seymour Skinner,No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese Needle Snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards.
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat."
Seymour Skinner,"No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death."
Seymour Skinner,Hm. Fifteen years of loyal service and this is how they tell me -- a jester with an invisible proclamation.
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, the President of Harvard would like a word with you."
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm... heck of a school. Weren't you at Brown, Otto?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson, report to the principal's office to discuss the results of yesterday's test."
Seymour Skinner,"I've just received some rather unusual news regarding your unprecedented A-triple-plus. To be honest, I'm surprised and saddened. No, not saddened, what's the word...? Ah yes, delighted."
Seymour Skinner,I'm delighted to report that your grade brought the entire school's GPA up to our state's minimum standard. We now qualify for a Basic Assistance Grant. It's the greatest honor the school has ever received! And it's all thanks to you.
Seymour Skinner,Your devotion to scholarship is a shining beacon to all who--
Seymour Skinner,"You cheated? Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Why didn't Miss Hoover tell me?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well... then, one could make the argument... that... there really is no problem."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, now, leave the money out of this. It's not the money's fault you cheated. Besides, I've already started spending it. Check out the new scoreboard!"
Seymour Skinner,"Look around, Lisa. That grant money could do a lot of good."
Seymour Skinner,We could buy real periodic tables instead of these promotional ones from Oscar Mayer.
Seymour Skinner,"And for the first time ever, our computer lab actually has a computer in it."
Seymour Skinner,I don't know. I'm not even sure we can keep this one. It's up to Lisa.
Seymour Skinner,"And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: State Comptroller Atkins."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no it isn't! Don't listen to her! She's out of her mind!"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, good old predictable Lisa! I knew her conscience was a ticking time bomb."
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, people, let's have a round of applause for the real Comptroller."
Seymour Skinner,I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now.
Seymour Skinner,Life insurance? Hmmm... Will I be able to borrow against the equity?
Seymour Skinner,"Hey! Hey! Settle down, children. Now, who's ever wondered how the post office works? No one?"
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, yes. Last year... anyway, look. Here comes our guide for the day, Postmaster Bill."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm just glad I work at an elementary school."
Seymour Skinner,Whew. Mercy. Good evening. Our old friend Noah Webster defines laughter as the act or sound of laughing--
Seymour Skinner,"Well illustrated, Nelson. And now, fasten your funnybones for Groundskeeper -- oh, or should I say Grinskeeper... No, I'm sorry, Groundskeeper was correct -- Willie!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name of ""Who"" is on first."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, seems as though we're just about at the halfway point, so why don't we call it intermission?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half."
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, Mother. I was driving through a tunnel and my cel phone wouldn't work."
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, look. A dimmer switch could ratchet up the romance in our love nest."
Seymour Skinner,"What's the matter, Edna? Lately you just say ""Ha!"" to everything."
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, I'm gonna pop you a question and... I hope the answer is yes."
Seymour Skinner,"And now, because the children are our future, here are the children of Springfield Elementary with a song they call ""The Children are our Future."" Children?"
Seymour Skinner,Wait! Wait! We have one more act! The patriotic comedy stylings of Bart Simpson!
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, Martin. For your community service, you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs."
Seymour Skinner,"Good, I want you to pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore here."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, not all community service is gang warfare and dangerous infection. And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working."
Seymour Skinner,"No Lisa, you're more than qualified. I've shared all your standardized test scores with the other members."
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to Mensa! You've joined such luminaries as cartoonist Mell Lazarus, Geena Davis, and Parade Magazine's Marilyn vos Savant."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I think you're going to fit in just fine around here."
Seymour Skinner,"Excuse me, gentlemen. Might I take a peek at your gazebo reservation form?"
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm... I guess it would be the ""it."" I'm not exactly sure to what that refers, it's a..."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Chief, thank God you're here. We reserved gazebo seven, and look!"
Seymour Skinner,"According to the charter, should the Mayor abdicate, a council of learned citizens may rule in his stead."
Seymour Skinner,And we've really elevated the level of discourse at the dog track.
Seymour Skinner,"We replaced the fanfare with classical music, and instead of chasing a rabbit the dogs chase a diploma."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, excellent. Not only are the trains now running on time, they're running on metric time."
Seymour Skinner,"Remember this moment, people. Eighty past two on April forty-seventh. It's the dawn of an enlightened Springfield."
Seymour Skinner,We have some new rules and regulations that you're just gonna go ape poopie over. Professor Frink?
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, ladies and gentlemen. I must apologize. This man does not speak for the council of Alphas. We hold you sub-Omeguloids in the highest regard."
Seymour Skinner,"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
Seymour Skinner,I'll be blunt. Bart's latest escapade goes far beyond the realm of the hijink.
Seymour Skinner,"Your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true."
Seymour Skinner,"But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. Just look at this pattern."
Seymour Skinner,"Very well, but there's no escaping the truth. Bart has a classic case of Attention Deficit Disorder."
Seymour Skinner,"How should I know? The point is, A.D.D. makes children restless and easily distracted."
Seymour Skinner,"Please, Mr. Simpson. I'm afraid I'll have to expel your son."
Seymour Skinner,"... Unless you're willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous..."
Seymour Skinner,"What a day. First the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this!"
Seymour Skinner,"I hope you all enjoy your ride to and tour of the Springfield Shopper Newspaper. Groundskeeper Willie and I will stay behind to remove all traces of asbestos and the word ""evolution"" from our school."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Now I'd like to ask each child to pair up with a buddy, so no one gets lost."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, Uter? I don't remember any Uter. Silly name -- Uter."
Seymour Skinner,She's been crushed! And so have the hopes of our mathletics team.
Seymour Skinner,"This is a proud day. Now, when people ask if we're in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, ""We are closer than ever before!"""
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you. To inaugurate our ramp system, here's the first of what I hope will be many disabled students. Bart Simpson!"
Seymour Skinner,"The good news is, we need no longer fear vicious mob reprisals."
Seymour Skinner,"But due to lack of funds, Springfield Elementary is closed forever."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, you keep asking me that. And I keep telling you, over there."
Seymour Skinner,"As for the school, we are exploring various options to raise the two hundred thousand dollars we need."
Seymour Skinner,You're right. It's hopeless. No one has that kind of money.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, well, maybe we can pry open his wallet with a slick, professional pitch. A school play!"
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to the world premiere of ""The Nice Man Giveth."""
Seymour Skinner,"Aaaaaand freeze! Now, who in Springfield will eat the poisoned broth? Whoo, it could be anyone, even Mr. Burns."
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. Burns, I'll be honest. We had a hidden agenda tonight."
Seymour Skinner,The holiday season is approaching and these children need a school...
Seymour Skinner,"Now, be careful with those video cameras, children. In order to buy them, the school board had to eliminate geography."
Seymour Skinner,"This globe will never spin again. Now, class, I want you to be creative with your video projects. I don't want to see thirty ""Blair Witch"" knock-offs."
Seymour Skinner,"Awards and honors are great, but they don't pay the pickle man."
Seymour Skinner,I'm an imposter. That man is the real Seymour Skinner.
Seymour Skinner,Go ahead and laugh! We have a better town bird!
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm, it's not like the Who to be tardy. I'm worried."
Seymour Skinner,"So Bart, our school policy is to give students in your situation straight A's."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, head-lice inspection day. While the kids are out getting their nits picked, we can have our own private ""cootie call."""
Seymour Skinner,"Our mayor's corrupt?! Oh, Mr. X has done this town a great service, despite his poor grammar and spelling."
Seymour Skinner,"But we'll have the last laugh on those Johnny-Come-Not-lies. We're gonna watch my favorite movie, about a Grinchy little character who tries to ""steal"" Christmas."
Seymour Skinner,"There it is. Take off, and have a frank and productive holiday."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, it seems the phone lines are down. So I'm afraid we're stuck here for the duration."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes, yes. We all had plans. Except for me, ironically. I'm right where I want to be."
Seymour Skinner,I don't care if you're Kristi Yamaguchi. No one leaves the building.
Seymour Skinner,I don't care if they're kissing Kristi Yamaguchi. You're not going home.
Seymour Skinner,"If you don't eat your relish, you're not getting any mayonnaise."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I hope you've all learned something from Nelson's headstrongedness. Now from now on..."
Seymour Skinner,"It's getting ugly out there. Think, Skinner, think. What would Superintendent Chalmers do?"
Seymour Skinner,"That elephant ate my entire platoon. Well, I'm not gonna let it happen again."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm not joking, people! From now on there will be no talking out of turn, or leaving this room. Willie?"
Seymour Skinner,"Actually, there are. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty... Uh, can you two share a hook?"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, now children, if you have to answer nature's call during the night, use this bucket next to Bart's head."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, well, here's a scouring pad. It's just as good."
Seymour Skinner,"I know it looks like the path to freedom, but one collapse and presto, you've got a snow casket."
Seymour Skinner,"Defying orders, eh? Well, I see you Scotsmen are thrifty with courage, too."
Seymour Skinner,That's precisely the problem and you know it. Now get me out of here!
Seymour Skinner,This is a gross misuse of school property. Where are the dodge balls?
Seymour Skinner,"All right, that's it! I'm writing all your names on the detention list in my mind."
Seymour Skinner,"Nelson, put that globe down! Milhouse, stay out of my desk! Jimbo, that's my Princi Award!"
Seymour Skinner,"If I were a billionaire, why would I be living with my mother?"
Seymour Skinner,They're just not responding to logic anymore. I'll never win this alone. There's only one guy who can help me now.
Seymour Skinner,"Nelson, if you get me outta this, there's a hall monitor position coming open in the spring..."
Seymour Skinner,"Not ""Huck Finn""! I spent hours crossing out the sassback!"
Seymour Skinner,"You did it, Nibbles. Now chew through my ball sack."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's pretending things didn't happen. And I think this is one of those."
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to the third lecture in our series on ""Not Putting Things Up Your Nose."" Please welcome Homer Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, we are canceling art, music, and dance. Please evacuate the auditorium before it's bulldozed into a mini-mall."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, the only other one to apply was Moe Syszlak, and his stuff scares the hell out of me."
Seymour Skinner,"How could anyone consider that making love? All right, Jack, you're hired. I'll clear you out a cubby."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, it's all wrong. The shapely female form has no place in art."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, if you want to keep this job, you'll make it your style."
Seymour Skinner,"Darn right, I'm the boss. Don't forget, I can send you back where you came from... college boy."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a school mural, I almost thought he said a school Muriel. Muriel's his sister. And uh... Thank you, Bruce Vilanch."
Seymour Skinner,"And now, I present ""Puma Pride"" by a college-educated artist..."
Seymour Skinner,No napkin could wipe the crumbs of failure from your mouth.
Seymour Skinner,"Now, ah, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I think the kids will follow it to Tuesday."
Seymour Skinner,"Crowley's an ex-con?! Dear Lord, I've peed in front of him!"
Seymour Skinner,That felon could have torched the whole school... were it not stuffed with asbestos.
Seymour Skinner,What I do for my allowance money is nobody's business.
Seymour Skinner,"Now, Bob, uh, your graduate degrees more than qualify you to be assistant janitor."
Seymour Skinner,But I am a bit troubled by your constant attempts to murder people.
Seymour Skinner,Good luck. That kid's like the Road Runner. He won't go down.
Seymour Skinner,"I-- You know, Bob, your voice would be perfect for the school's morning announcements."
Seymour Skinner,"... so, from now on anything caught in your zipper will be handled by the school nurse, and not me. And now... are you adequately prepared to rock?"
Seymour Skinner,That's not true! This assembly was my idea. I like your brand of inoffensive pop rock.
Seymour Skinner,"No, I didn't. I even came in early and made orange drink."
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, Drederick Tatum. That was truly a K.O. Knockout Oration."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, looks like our phenomenon is actually a phenomenot. Because when you look at it rationally..."
Seymour Skinner,"But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teacher's lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh my goodness, an untied shoelace. I'll just get down on one knee and retie that."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, that was terrible. I'll just sprinkle you all with some amnesia dust."
Seymour Skinner,"A second grade sorceress so powerful, she made tonight's refreshments out of dead people."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally, this town will have a real claim to fame."
Seymour Skinner,And our school board's cut us back to sixteen! All of them lanthanides.
Seymour Skinner,"Now Willie, don't tell anyone I'm trying my stand-up comedy act tonight. If the students find out I'm performing at Floppy's, I'll never live it down."
Seymour Skinner,"Now. I'll give you directions, starting from the Simpsons' house..."
Seymour Skinner,"I just hope the audience is kind because my material is weak and, uh, and I have that bladder thing."
Seymour Skinner,"So, it's, uh, standardized testing time again. Have you ever noticed how the dumb kids fill in the wrong circles?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lost my place. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe a little, uh, improv would ""raise the roof,"" here. Would someone name a profession?"
Seymour Skinner,How come you always run out of tardy slips before you run out of permission slips?
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to Career Day. Here to tell you about his job is Bart's friend's Dad, Kirk Van Houten."
Seymour Skinner,"I see. Well, we, uh, still have fifty-six minutes left. Any questions?"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, Seamus. Ninety minutes of watching a man drink in a bathtub."
Seymour Skinner,"Seamus, uh, we won't need you to speak any more."
Seymour Skinner,"Wow! Walter Mondale, Marvin Hamlisch, Mark Fuhrman... The former President of Procter and Gamble?"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, fine. He'll do. Anything to end this unstructured conversation."
Seymour Skinner,"...and in a gutless act of political correctness, pizza day will now be known as ""Italian-American sauce bread day."""
Seymour Skinner,"And now today's guest speaker... the creator of ""Danger Dog,"" Geoff Jenkins!"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well then, eh, tell the children how hard you studied in school to get where you are today."
Seymour Skinner,"Fire, children -- hurry outside! There's no time to let today's lecture sink in!"
Seymour Skinner,I won't stand by while you're glamorizing sass! Now those youngsters will throw their lives away... drawing things that never were.
Seymour Skinner,"The 2nd Battle of Springfield was fought by the North...the South...and the East...to keep Springfield in, out of, and next to the Union, respectively. Now, the actual battle was fought over there, where that man is standing. But he won't move, so we'll do it here."
Seymour Skinner,This battlefield is rife with inaccuracy. You dead people stop playing cards. And Stonewall Jackson... stop roller blading.
Seymour Skinner,"Are you mad, Brunella? You can't fail Lisa. She's the only child keeping this school accredited. Without her, we'd have to release these children back into the forest. So let's just turn that minus into a plus..."
Seymour Skinner,Did they have to guess the date of my death?
Seymour Skinner,"When I was starting out, they said ""You're good -- but are you 'plaque' good?"" Well, today I can say ""Yes I am!"""
Seymour Skinner,"...Three, two one. Thank you. I will now take pre-approved questions from honor-roll students."
Seymour Skinner,"Now normally I wouldn't go near a giant chocolate cake in my dress polyester, but with Bart Simpson safely encapsulated, I'd be delighted to pose."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah Mother, may I read a magazine while I wait in the car?"
Seymour Skinner,This air conditioning is better than any truant officer. I'm seeing students I haven't seen in years.
Seymour Skinner,Now let's raise the roof for the bland informative rap of M. C. Safety and the Caution Crew!
Seymour Skinner,"Heh-heh-heh, watch out Beatles! Now I have one more important announcement to share with you. Would Lisa Simpson join me on stage?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, because of your outstanding score on yesterday's big test, you're being immediately moved up to... the third grade!"
Seymour Skinner,"Okay Bart, since you like attention so much, I have a second announcement."
Seymour Skinner,"I was going to tell you this privately, but... because of your incredibly low test score, we're sending you back to third grade."
Seymour Skinner,Bart and Lisa are lost in Capital City and presumed crying.
Seymour Skinner,"I'm so sorry. Lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her."
Seymour Skinner,"We're looking. But in the meantime, the Class Clown Pro Tem will take his place."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, if this episode has taught us anything, it's that nothing works better than the status quo. Bart, you're promoted back to the fourth grade."
Seymour Skinner,"And Lisa, you have a choice. You may continue to be challenged in third grade, or return to second grade and be merely a big fish in a small pond--"
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, sir. And what more fitting finale than to gaze reverently at Old Glory."
Seymour Skinner,"Wait, this just doesn't add up. Milhouse has never been anything but a comic foil."
Seymour Skinner,Then Krusty will feel my wrath! The spritz has hit the fan.
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, about that. Mother's neck wattle got caught in a zipper. I've got a long night of boo-boo kissing ahead of me but don't worry, I got you these store-bought apples instead."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I must have the wrong classroom. I was looking for my girlfriend, not Pam Dawber."
Seymour Skinner,"Are you ready for a little after school special? Eyes front, Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,Hello? Mother?... I'll be right there. Now she wants to get out of the tub.
Seymour Skinner,I'll be back in three hours. Maybe less. But almost certainly more.
Seymour Skinner,"As Principal, I'd just like to say a few words about what this wonderful woman means to this school and to me."
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, you're no stranger to the inner-workings of the female mind."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm a little worried that, uh, with all this attention, Edna may meet someone better."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I've been a fool. I've gotta go after her."
Seymour Skinner,"Well technically since she's paying for the room, she brought me."
Seymour Skinner,"This woman carried me for nine and a half months. I was out for two weeks, then went back in."
Seymour Skinner,I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, since Edna dumped me, I've been wandering around this park all night. It's educational and offers mild thrills. Just like Edna."
Seymour Skinner,"Good Lord, I may lose Edna forever. I've gotta stop her from winning. Then she'll be broken, miserable and mine."
Seymour Skinner,"Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I don't want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, Bart, I didn't want to resort to this, but... this drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary late last week."
Seymour Skinner,This is the worst thing I've ever done. Even worse than what I did in 'Nam.
Seymour Skinner,"I'm sorry, everyone. I perpetrated this charade. The boy can read, and Edna Krabappel is the greatest teacher I have ever known. If she can teach me to love, then she can teach anything."
Seymour Skinner,"Not on your life, Reverend. From now on, I'm my own man."
Seymour Skinner,"Edna Krabappel, will you marry me? Now I must warn you, two months' salary only bought me the ring box."
Seymour Skinner,Do you want to check out the bed of tomorrow... today?
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm, there appears to be a red dot on my trouser fronts. I'd better lower them."
Seymour Skinner,"The dot also appears to be on my underpants. Well, down they go."
Seymour Skinner,I could easily put them back in their original order.
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, did you get the letter about your pay cut?"
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome back, children. We've all had fascinating summers. I was the Maitre D' at the Springfield Country Club."
Seymour Skinner,"Um, we'd better get down to business. As this is a non-leap year, we're already a day behind."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, if by ""wank"" you mean educational fun, then stand back, it's wanking time."
Seymour Skinner,Let's get the year rolling with an all-school spelling bee!
Seymour Skinner,"Well, we're down to our last two students. Milhouse, your word is ""choke."""
Seymour Skinner,"There'll be time for that later. Now, you can concentrate on representing our school at the state spelling finals."
Seymour Skinner,And here's your prize for today: a scale model of the planet Mars.
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, to honor Springfield Elementary's shining star, we are granting you a double-wide locker."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, this is as romantic as the night I proposed."
Seymour Skinner,I was kinda hoping we could use this audio cassette.
Seymour Skinner,"Before we begin, children, may I remind you the school computers are not to be used to access PrincipalSkinnerStinks.com, Skinnersucks.org or Shavedskinner.edu."
Seymour Skinner,"Now today we have a special guest: a documentary filmmaker whose works include ""Lost Luggage, Shattered Lives,"" and ""Upskirt Dreams."" Please welcome Declan Desmond."
Seymour Skinner,"Powerful work. And now he's going to make a documentary about Springfield Elementary, which I assume will be glowing and positive, unlike all of his other work."
Seymour Skinner,Hitting it off already! I haven't seen such a natural pair since half-sandwich and soup of the day.
Seymour Skinner,"I'll just leave you two alone. Remember, as far as he knows, we still teach math."
Seymour Skinner,I certainly appreciate you helping us out with this field trip.
Seymour Skinner,"Look children, that giant clam appears to be opening. This could be a wonderful journal entry!"
Seymour Skinner,Read the directions silently as I read them aloud to you.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, thank you. Mother always said a curvy spine is the devil's roller coaster."
Seymour Skinner,"Due to budget cuts, music class will now have a two drink minimum. Cranapple juice only counts as one. And...."
Seymour Skinner,Congratulations Mr. Student Body President -- your casino night is a huge success.
Seymour Skinner,"Martin, in light of this fiasco, you're going to have to resign as president."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I guess we're gonna need a new student body president."
Seymour Skinner,"""Lisa..."" ""Lisa..."" ""Lisa..."" Wow, she even beat perennial write-in candidate ""Skinner Sucks."""
Seymour Skinner,The students will do anything she says. She's captured their imagination like a bright piece of construction paper.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh hello, Lisa. We were just uh, discussing Vasco De Gama."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed. Don't hide your light in a smoky back room, making dusty old decisions."
Seymour Skinner,"But just in case you want to do any more thinking, I'm proud to present you with an official key to the study hall."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, it's like you're Harry Potter without the magic and wonder. Just sign these authorization forms and you can be on your way."
Seymour Skinner,That little girl should learn to read things before she signs them.
Seymour Skinner,"I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY EVIL PLAN / SAY GOODBYE TO MUSIC, GYM AND ART / SOON WE WILL HAVE THE PERFECT SCHOOL / WHERE FUN AND EXCITEMENT NEVER START!"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm, not a cloud in the sky -- a perfect day to unveil Operation SLAAAM: So Long Athletics Art And Music. Care for a T-shirt?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, student government is meaningless. Look at your constitution. It's written on the back of a placemat."
Seymour Skinner,Gimme that. Any student caught striking will be severely disciplined. Unless all of you do it. Then I'm stymied.
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, please. Help me lure them back. I had to do what I did. Our budget is stretched tighter than mother's sauna pants."
Seymour Skinner,Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
Seymour Skinner,You want to get rid of Lisa?! But she's such a good student!
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson, you have just been transferred to the Springfield magnet school for the gifted and troublesome. Please climb into the idling bus."
Seymour Skinner,But how can you afford all this on a widower's salary?
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, we don't need wedding china. The dishes mother won on ""Let's Make A Deal"" are holding up nicely."
Seymour Skinner,"And I suppose those wedding guests will also pay for dishwashing liquid, heated water, and two-sided sponges?"
Seymour Skinner,... and while the school's only ball is being repaired...
Seymour Skinner,"... the following alternative sports will be offered: dodge-rock, volley-brick, and base-game."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed."
Seymour Skinner,"Homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. Would you please return my pants and/or underpants so I can go home?"
Seymour Skinner,I can't -- I might be called upon to give directions later.
Seymour Skinner,There's something I've wanted to say to you for a long time. Am I a good principal?
Seymour Skinner,"You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield."
Seymour Skinner,"Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone."
Seymour Skinner,You know I'm not. We had a long discussion about that where I clearly indicated the coldness of my feet.
Seymour Skinner,"I don't know Edna, I'm not quite ready to take that plunge."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this is it, Edna. As I once said at the battle of Khe Sanh, I surrender."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm uh, I'm afraid Edna has gone from tardy to absent. So uh, let's uh move onto the reception and forget this awkwardness with some delicious shrimp mocktail."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, in retrospect, I could have been a little more ""into"" the whole thing."
Seymour Skinner,"""Just The Two Of Us."" I spent fifteen dollars on those dance lessons, might as well use 'em."
Seymour Skinner,"Forward, side, together. Back, side, together. Forward, side, together. Back, side, together..."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh God, I've lost the love of my life. Bart's right, I am a wiener."
Seymour Skinner,"That was before I missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!"
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back. How's that, Homer?"
Seymour Skinner,Every second without you is like a million kicks in the crotch.
Seymour Skinner,"Homer, Marge, if I could just speak to Edna for a moment."
Seymour Skinner,MS. KRABAPPEL / A SAD PRINCIPAL / IS DESPERATE AND NEEDY / IF YOU COME HOME / I WON'T DIE ALONE / AND THAT'S WHAT I'D PREFER...
Seymour Skinner,What are you doing in Edna's place? Where is she?
Seymour Skinner,They told me it was Catman! Now prepare for some roughhousing.
Seymour Skinner,"Hm, tough crowd. Uh, would everyone just rise for our National Anthem?"
Seymour Skinner,"Your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of America's only losing war."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh sure, Marge. Just like ""blind Bart,"" ""wheelchair Bart,"" ""pregnant Bart"" and my personal favorite, ""railroad spike through head Bart."""
Seymour Skinner,"Are you kidding? I love it. I once had a principal like that. Now, come with me."
Seymour Skinner,"This, young lady, is a mimeo machine. A hand-operated duplicating device -- no electricity needed."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally, in nineteen ninety-two, I was reunited with that chair. It wasn't quite the same."
Seymour Skinner,"They're just asserting their independence. If a child doesn't do it now, it may never happen."
Seymour Skinner,"Step right up, and bid on items donated by local businesses!"
Seymour Skinner,A chance to bring down Bart Simpson? Our school's second most-wanted criminal after the mysterious El Barto?
Seymour Skinner,Hi. Would you mind showing us video footage of your last concert?
Seymour Skinner,Not yet. Can we verify exactly what time Bart was at the show?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Share with us the wisdom of the street, oh mighty Alcatraaaz."
Seymour Skinner,Do you think there's a place in the hip-hop world for a forty-something elementary school administrator?
Seymour Skinner,"Happy three in the morning, everyone! In a mere five hours, we'll be gazing at Springfield's most exciting glacier, Springfield Glacier. I hope you're all wearing glacier-appropriate clothing."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, well, while I disagree with your T-shirt's assertion, I do encourage anything that raises glacier awareness. Busward to adventure!"
Seymour Skinner,"So, Edna, I uh, I wrote up some possible discussion topics for this trip. Oh, here's one: I'm still in love with you. Discuss?"
Seymour Skinner,"Behold, children. The majesty of Springfield Glacier! Crane your necks skyward to behold its icy glory."
Seymour Skinner,I'm going to exchange this beach towel I bought at Sequoia National Park.
Seymour Skinner,"Dying alone, huh? Terrible fate to befall any woman -- ice-age or modern-day."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh for goodness sake. You've moved on, have you? Well, so have I."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, because of your sister's restraining order, there is no place in this school you can legally occupy, without violating your order. Observe."
Seymour Skinner,"A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building."
Seymour Skinner,I will. But there is one place on school property that falls outside all laws of man or God.
Seymour Skinner,We've got to upgrade Springfield's image -- show them we're more than just a town that's still afraid of eclipses.
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome seniors and sexually precocious underclassmen. I'd like to say goodbye to those who are going off to college, or to fight in Gulf War Five: ""Operation Find Our President's Head."""
Seymour Skinner,"Attention everyone. Please welcome our Valedictorian, Lisa Simpson. She will be attending Yale...I mean, Hot Dog on a Stick Management Camp."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, now that you've graduated I can finally say this: you really press my cider."
Seymour Skinner,Yes! Of course I do. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU / HA--
Seymour Skinner,Really? I'm a Libra. There's a lot of compatibility there.
Seymour Skinner,"Sir, this school has a strict no-animal policy. I assume these are hypothetical dogs and poni?"
Seymour Skinner,Yes. I saw those when my normal grocery store was on strike.
Seymour Skinner,"The best photographs, or ""photos"", will be prominently displayed in the school lobby all year long."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I guess you didn't find anything interesting to photograph."
Seymour Skinner,"Now as queen, you shall be entitled to eat the same French Fries the teachers do."
Seymour Skinner,"So Willie, during the festival, you'll be wearing these urine-soaked rags. You're the village idiot!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, allow me to apply this rubber cement to your face -- to represent the ravages of plague."
Seymour Skinner,"Now peasants, since the middle ages had no compact discs or Super Mario Men, people found entertainment in abusing the village idiot. So, let history come alive!"
Seymour Skinner,It's the backseat of my Merkur. There's thirty-seven cents in the coin caddy. And stay out of my diary!
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm sick of playing the tomfool. You are hereby expelled from Springfield Elementary!"
Seymour Skinner,"""Ebony and Ivory""? I'm afraid that song's taken! By me and my mother. You know, people say when we're on stage, it's more like ""Scary-oke."" Scary talented, I assume."
Seymour Skinner,"Capital! My mother and I have been performing together since I was in fourth grade, and it's really brought us closer."
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, Mother. I have your eye balm in my man-purse right here."
Seymour Skinner,Which of you boys hurled Lisa Simpson's backpack through my window?
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I hold in my hand a sticker with a frowny-face on it. Don't make me affix it to your file!"
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I'm afraid we have a real problem with Lisa."
Seymour Skinner,"Your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a Thermos-brand thermos onto the street!"
Seymour Skinner,I've asked the school psychologist to shed some light on your daughter's sudden burst of inappropriateness.
Seymour Skinner,"""Daddy's Face-down Thanksgiving,"" ""Left at the Grand Canyon,"" ""The Day a Policeman Came to My Soccer Game."""
Seymour Skinner,"The school is looking for a new ""Safety Salamander"". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender."
Seymour Skinner,"Okay Lisa... ...to study in Rome, an applicant needs outstanding grades, check... Uh-oh. Lisa, it says you have to speak fluent Italian."
Seymour Skinner,Flawless logic. But I am going to have to ask you to speak a few phrases to verify your fluency.
Seymour Skinner,"Though not now, because I have a series of important meetings."
Seymour Skinner,Because it's terrible for me. But I'll get back to you. Soon.
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, nineteen ninety-five. A fine year for Camrys. No one would ever guess you spent three months in a lake."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm, that's odd -- we only turn the heat on for parents' night."
Seymour Skinner,This wood is more buckled than a pilgrim's hat. But who's responsible?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, thank you, Myra. To highlight the seriousness of Bart's offense, Superintendent Chalmers will be joining us by video uplink."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, well you won't think it's so funny when we send Bart here."
Seymour Skinner,"It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, ""tough hate"", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away."
Seymour Skinner,Now I have a ring tone for my brand new cell phone.
Seymour Skinner,"Children, your gym teacher Ms. Pommelhorst has a brief announcement."
Seymour Skinner,"We're telling you children now, so you can adjust and not make jokes."
Seymour Skinner,"Precisely the type of wordplay I seek to discourage. ""New wood."" Now, please welcome your new gym teacher: Coach Krupts!"
Seymour Skinner,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to announce the winner of the science fair. Though I must note I'm surprised Lisa Simpson didn't enter a project this year!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, mother, aren't you glad you didn't get more intimate with him?"
Seymour Skinner,"It is with great joy and a sense of once again everything is back to where it started, that we welcome our once and future Groundskeeper... Willie!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now let's all enjoy some punch and cookies. Willie, you can start cleaning up now."
Seymour Skinner,"And when you're done, here are the keys to your new shack."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, do you expect me to believe that? That story is the biggest load of... Krabappel? Making out with Moe?"
Seymour Skinner,"You know, Juliana, it's no surprise you became such a success. You always got straight ""A's"" in school."
Seymour Skinner,"No, all I meant was, from what I've seen, boys are better at math, science... the real subjects. There, that should put the matter behind us."
Seymour Skinner,"No, of course not! I don't know why girls are worse."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, one thing we can all agree on though -- this little lady sure looks pretty tonight. Am I right?"
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, I have a plan: pretend I agree with them."
Seymour Skinner,"Today we celebrate the first of many, many, many, many diversity forums."
Seymour Skinner,"Why is it that women ""appear"" to be worse at math then men? What is the source of this ""illusion?"" Or, as I call it, ""the biggest lie ever told."""
Seymour Skinner,"Please believe me, I understand the problems of women... see?"
Seymour Skinner,"Am I wearing women's clothes? I didn't notice. When I look in my closet, I don't see male clothes or female clothes. They're all the same."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, no... of course not! Women are unique in every way!"
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, no. It's the differences -- of which there are none -- that make the sameness... exceptional. Just tell me what to say!"
Seymour Skinner,"You know, I still think about you all the time."
Seymour Skinner,"Class, starting today we will be presenting an alternative theory on the origin of man."
Seymour Skinner,"Hm, this helpful video will evade all your questions. Eyes screenward!"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, you've said quite enough. Children, drown her out with whistling and arm flatulence."
Seymour Skinner,"Now honestly, the Bible's about the same age as the rest of our textbooks."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes, every day we go through this. Why don't you just incinerate the contraband."
Seymour Skinner,Careful with those peanut crumbs! My allergy is so sensitive a single molecule would make my throat close like a museum at four forty-five.
Seymour Skinner,I'M A COOTIE EATER / I'VE BEEN ONE ALL MY LIFE. / I LIKE THE COOTIES SO MUCH / I HAVE A COOTIE WIFE.
Seymour Skinner,Excuse me. I'm supposed to stand in your store window and breastfeed Bilbo Baggins.
Seymour Skinner,"Simpson, you've been waving your nuts in my face for too long. Eat shrimp and die!"
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, field-trippers, welcome to the Springfield Tide Pools -- nature's most fecund eco-system!"
Seymour Skinner,"Who will spot the playful abalone? The mighty winkle? I think it might be you, Sherri!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now remember, these pools can be dangerous, so everyone pick a buddy."
Seymour Skinner,Shut up! I'm just giving him CPR -- the kiss of life! And if anyone loves Bart it's Nelson.
Seymour Skinner,Never woke up because he never passed out. He's right over there.
Seymour Skinner,"Splendid, Lisa. By far the best presentation of the day!"
Seymour Skinner,"And you should be. The city's Multicultural Council has invited one lucky student to perform at City Hall. Lisa, you'll be representing us, and the noble Hitachee people!"
Seymour Skinner,"My God, Willie, that fire is headed right for the tetherball pole! Put it out!"
Seymour Skinner,"Then I'm afraid these ""Wet Ones"" will have to do the job."
Seymour Skinner,"What monster, or pair of monsters, would steal our extinguishers?"
Seymour Skinner,"Simpson, I know you're behind this. Well, you are gonna get some counseling from our school psychologist."
Seymour Skinner,"Zimmerman, Zorx, and... Zzyzwiski. Now back to class, all of you."
Seymour Skinner,"Sir, if we let these hill folk into our school, our test scores would drop so low, we'd lose all federal funding."
Seymour Skinner,Plus our last bake sale was a disaster. People took bites without buying the cookies.
Seymour Skinner,HOW DO WE STOP HER WRITING UP WHAT SHE SAW?
Seymour Skinner,Made with the fondue set I bought you for Christmas?
Seymour Skinner,"I'm afraid that due to funding cuts, we've had to sell the Science Department skeleton and replace it with this Halloween costume."
Seymour Skinner,"Moving on, our class trip to Italy is now spaghetti night at Papa John's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded."
Seymour Skinner,We will conclude by passing around a sheet on which I would like everyone's email address.
Seymour Skinner,"/ It's weren't nothin', really. / Just doin' our job. /"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, gentlemen... I'm uh... I'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here."
Seymour Skinner,I think what she would treasure most is a gift bought through honest effort. Because...
Seymour Skinner,...integrity... trust... exploitation... the golden rule... role models... serious crime... zero tolerance... the Ten Commandments...
Seymour Skinner,"Time for a head count. Children, line up according to height... no, weight... no, the sum total of the letters in your last names if each letter is assigned a numeric value according to its place in the alphabet! Quickly now!"
Seymour Skinner,Behold -- our new state-of-the-art weapon in the global war against misbehavior!
Seymour Skinner,"We've got what we need -- Milhouse, bring them in."
Seymour Skinner,"Lord, give me guidance. That's right, the guidance department -- detention room. Thank you, Mrs. Lord."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, of course -- I think we can wrangle you a used bicycle. Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy? Bart? Where did he-- My car keys!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes, yes. We have to do something. Although, the basketball hoops have been retracted... D.J. Funtimes has already cashed his deposit... And Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear..."
Seymour Skinner,Um... that uh... bake sale revenue projections are through the roof.
Seymour Skinner,"Possibly, but I can't risk Superintendent Chalmers finding out about--"
Seymour Skinner,Um... about how early press coverage of the bake sale is uniformly positive.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it seems someone was riding the giant tortoise naked."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, if you like, I'm certified to conduct a mock father-daughter conversation."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, a principal's dream would be to have a school with nothing but Lisa Simpsons. Unfortunately, the rest of you exist."
Seymour Skinner,And now the reason we're all here today... Lisa Simpson!
Seymour Skinner,"That's terrific, but I called you here to discuss your son's misbehavior on the school bus."
Seymour Skinner,"May I have a clean American newspaper, please, no ""Doonesbury?"""
Seymour Skinner,"Students, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The coolest student in school, Milhouse Van Houten, is leaving us."
Seymour Skinner,"He and his uncle, who is also very cool, will be returning to Solvang forever... via hot air balloon."
Seymour Skinner,"What about the media? They're not covering the issues, they just want to declare a frontrunner and go back to their mansions."
Seymour Skinner,"""Air Skinner"" brings it up. He bounces the ball repeatedly, in a dribbling-type motion."
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, children. Welcome to the unveiling of our new school lunch purchasing plan, known as the Flex Plan."
Seymour Skinner,"Students may spend up to ten points per day in up to four of seven categories. Unused points roll over week to week, but not month to month. Categories not included: meat, dairy, vegetables..."
Seymour Skinner,"Who did this? Until I find out, no one is leaving this mixed-use auditorium."
Seymour Skinner,"When I catch the culprit, and I will, I'm gonna throw this away..."
Seymour Skinner,"By law, the most we can give him is a ten day suspension."
Seymour Skinner,"All our other attempts to get a spy inside the Bart Simpson operation have failed. Uter, Ralph, Doug the hip guidance counselor... he's never been the same since Bart got through with him."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh-oh, here he comes. Now this won't be easy, but pretend I'm a jerk."
Seymour Skinner,"Young man, I'm gonna be on you like a numerator on a denominator!"
Seymour Skinner,"Two whistles! I'm one whistle away from three whistles, people!"
Seymour Skinner,"Say Simpson, would you mind holding one end of this banner while I put it up?"
Seymour Skinner,"I knew egging my house was just a ploy. You see, the rat who told you about my rat was also a rat."
Seymour Skinner,"And it's all thanks to Donny here, who can happily live the rest of his life knowing he betrayed the one boy who actually cared about him."
Seymour Skinner,"Martin Prince was known by many names: Martin Priss, Martin Princess, Fartin' Prince, Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer..."
Seymour Skinner,"Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate."
Seymour Skinner,"Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby."
Seymour Skinner,"Cinema is my secret passion. I've even written a screenplay or two ""on speculation."""
Seymour Skinner,"When Edna Met Seymour... ""Ghost Willie""... ""Killing Seymour's Mother""... ""The Principal Who Sold A Screenplay""..."
Seymour Skinner,"Unfortunately, the studios have made it clear they're not interested in my work. In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome on the Universal Studios tour."
Seymour Skinner,"Forget grades! With the right subject, you could be a great filmmaker. What comes to mind when you think of drama?"
Seymour Skinner,Not the smarty-pants answer. Where's the drama in your life?
Seymour Skinner,"Family, eh? That's right, your brother is Bart Simpson, one of Mrs. Krabappel's fourth graders. And your father is a local character of note."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, if you make a documentary about your family, I can help you."
Seymour Skinner,"All I ask is, if you ever win an Oscar... give it to me."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
Seymour Skinner,"Sundance, the preeminent independent film festival held each January in Park City Utah?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, if we can't get into Sundance, would you like to check out its alternative cousin, Slam Dance?"
Seymour Skinner,"We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance."
Seymour Skinner,They don't even know that my pockets are full of bottled water and cornbread!
Seymour Skinner,"Seymour Skinner never puts all his eggs in one basket. That's why they call me ""Two Basket"" Skinner. What? They do."
Seymour Skinner,"Just wait for dessert, sir. I made it with you in mind."
Seymour Skinner,Out of gas! But how?! I put a dollar in this morning and we've only driven ninety cents.
Seymour Skinner,I understand. It can be very difficult for a woman to propose marriage. But I am willing to go halvsies on a ring.
Seymour Skinner,"Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!"
Seymour Skinner,"Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school pep squad could've cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven!"
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa. She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah yes, the one I've seen on Lisa's Facebook page."
Seymour Skinner,"I search all the children's Facebook pages for unflattering references to me. By the way, I enjoyed the photos of your trip to Yosemite."
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to another school year. One important note: the flower-based names of the reading groups are now barnyard-based. Mr. Becker has protested the move, so his group will remain the Daffodils."
Seymour Skinner,"I never tire of that. Uh, one other announcement, at the end of the month we'll be participating in the Vice-President's Assessment Test."
Seymour Skinner,"The V.P.A.T. is part of the Federal Government's ""No Child Left Alone Act."" It'll be a rewarding day of pencil sharpening and eyes-on-your-own-paper-keeping..."
Seymour Skinner,"So, when you take your practice test, take your number two pencil and..."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, quite so. As you can see, I'm holding a big number two in my hands, enjoying the weight and feel of it."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, we need to talk to you about your practice test."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you and the other perfect-scoring ""Superstars"" are exempt from taking the actual test today."
Seymour Skinner,"Brilliant plan to remove all the underperformers for test day, sir."
Seymour Skinner,I can't believe it. Superintendent Chalmers betrayed me. After all the wrapping paper I bought from his daughter.
Seymour Skinner,Let me explain this to you in terms even the simplest will understand. We're hiding you in Capital City for the day so your numb-skullery won't drag down the test scores of the children who are our future.
Seymour Skinner,"For your information, I am not a loser! I'm a successful principal who paints houses in the summertime."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, now we can get back on the bus and on..."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, stay calm, boys. Oh God! We're at the corner of Cesar Chavez Way and Martin Luther King Boulevard!"
Seymour Skinner,"My name isn't Skinrash, it's Principal Skinner, and you will address me as such."
Seymour Skinner,I'll deal with your insubordinate wordplay later. My first duty is to get you boys to safety and that's... where's Ralph?
Seymour Skinner,Shut up! A child is in danger under my aegis!
Seymour Skinner,Time to do what I've never done as principal: something.
Seymour Skinner,I am not spazzing out -- I'm using the principle of conservation of angular momentum to turn the container.
Seymour Skinner,We do teach it in school! You're too busy eating sugar snacks and horsing around!
Seymour Skinner,"""...But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."""
Seymour Skinner,Today I received an education in how children really learn: by seeing their principal run around on top of a shipping container.
Seymour Skinner,"So children, put down your answer sheet and drop that number two!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, I know what that means -- I've learned so much today! This is my school and I'm throwing out the test!"
Seymour Skinner,"And finally, effective immediately, I'm overturning this school's ban on dancing."
Seymour Skinner,Because we do our sleuthing in Mother's Nissan Quest Minivan.
Seymour Skinner,"You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony..."
Seymour Skinner,She dispatched a team of nuns to the New World to seek this fabulous gem...
Seymour Skinner,They landed at what is now Philadelphia...and used the timbers of their ship to construct a convent.
Seymour Skinner,"The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of ""independence"" to cover their search for the gem."
Seymour Skinner,"Fleeing the violence, the nuns of Saint Teresa's left the colonies and settled here in Springfield."
Seymour Skinner,"I see it too. Let's, uh, head that way. We'll walk, or drive, to... the obvious solution."
Seymour Skinner,Great crimes kill holy sage? The puzzle is solved! We must warn the holy sage at once!
Seymour Skinner,We could make it if we took Mr. Burns's helicopter.
Seymour Skinner,"The Sprinkle King, Sprinkle Queen, and Deluxe Sprinkle King are the Simon and Garfunkel plus one of hose-nozzle dispersal arrays. Observe."
Seymour Skinner,Hear that? He thinks my Try 'N' Save brand Shush Mutts are genuine Hush Puppies.
Seymour Skinner,"We've got the ""how"" , and we've got the ""who"" , but we don't have the ""why."""
Seymour Skinner,"Milhouse, you realize, if you're suspended, you'll be missing... taco Wednesday."
Seymour Skinner,"Crunchy shell, ground beef, lettuce, mild sauce... and of course, shredded cheddar cheese!"
Seymour Skinner,"Consider yourself suspended, mister. Willie, take him to the big house -- where he lives."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, your outburst was either a sign of deep emotional imbalance, or a passionate response to a sobering truth. Luckily, the treatment for both is intensive therapy."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I don't know. But when you go, could you return this Sports Illustrated for me?"
Seymour Skinner,"Someone must've, uh, put it in my bag. They do that, you know. They're always putting things in my bag!"
Seymour Skinner,"I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying ""I don't care. My kid's a loser."""
Seymour Skinner,"Hey, I want the ""check engine"" light on my dashboard to shut off, but that ain't gonna happen."
Seymour Skinner,We need Lisa Simpson at Springfield Elementary. She's our top student and she writes the fun facts in the morning announcements!
Seymour Skinner,This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I'm letting you go.
Seymour Skinner,I'm working on my magic act for the Faculty Follies. But right now I don't feel much like follying.
Seymour Skinner,There's a form to extend your health insurance on my desk.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you deserve a reward for telling the truth, and that reward will be in the form of a severe punishment."
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."
Seymour Skinner,"Children! Fingers in your ears and makes the ""la-la"" sound."
Seymour Skinner,"In order to save money, the following presidents will no longer be taught: Buchanan, Fillmore, Pierce, Bush, Bush... could you please stop that?"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson?! In detention?! My horoscope told me I'd see something interesting today, but I thought that meant the horoscope itself!"
Seymour Skinner,Standing up for yourself to an older boy? We're gonna have to set up an appointment with your parents.
Seymour Skinner,"And after this, it will be featured in the fifth-grade play ""The Crucible""!"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, well, I just thought, uh... specialization being the wave of the future... uh, probably..."
Seymour Skinner,"...It's called ""curling."" Players slide the heavy stones toward the circle, or ""house..."""
Seymour Skinner,...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, my cargo pants indicate that I'm not here on school business. I'm here on ""cool"" business, i.e. curling."
Seymour Skinner,"Astonishing news out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin: the Olympic Committee has announced that Mixed Curling will be a Demonstration Event at the Winter Olympics!"
Seymour Skinner,Someone has to convert that kinetic energy back into potential!
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, that involuntary pre-conscious reflex I made in utero was unforgivable."
Seymour Skinner,"That stone is coming in like a rocket! It's gotta be going four, maybe five miles an hour!"
Seymour Skinner,I was not bald! My fontanel was covered by lanugo!
Seymour Skinner,"One of your best, Ralph. Next up, we have Simpson, L.!"
Seymour Skinner,"These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson -- and no Milhouse, for that matter. Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds."
Seymour Skinner,"Big mistake, attacking me outside school hours and property! Legally, I can spank your bare bottoms!"
Seymour Skinner,You can't hide forever and I'm a very patient man! I once waited an hour and a half for a haircut.
Seymour Skinner,"Mrs. Krabappel had to go to Portland. Apparently, the people she hired to de-program her sister from that cult turned out to be an even worse cult."
Seymour Skinner,"Not you. Never you. And due to budget cuts, until Edna comes back, I have no choice but to merge the school's two fourth-grade classes."
Seymour Skinner,"Marge, Homer, this is Brody and Madison McKenna. Bart has been sharing a desk with their daughter Nikki."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention all students. Please report to an attorney-mandated school assembly. To make time for this, the third grade's performance of ""My Fair Lady"" is cancelled."
Seymour Skinner,Let's quickly prod him to the curb with this pool skimmer.
Seymour Skinner,"Nikki, no! I prefer a dead child to a lawsuit from your parents!"
Seymour Skinner,I see you're impressed by my costume for the school's annual drug awareness assembly.
Seymour Skinner,"Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn."
Seymour Skinner,"We're low on funding, so Ralph Wiggum will be standing in as your lectern."
Seymour Skinner,Excuse me. The podiums are needed in the art room as easels.
Seymour Skinner,"Good morning, children. Today we are instituting shortened school hours."
Seymour Skinner,"Seriously? Why? With Nelson gone, lunch money's finally making its way to the cafeteria. Nurples are returning to their natural, non-purple hue. Besides, I hear he's doing quite well with his bicycle pimpery."
Seymour Skinner,Eleven dollars an hour? That's night watchman money. Maybe I should have a chat with him.
Seymour Skinner,"It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. I know he likes the sleeveless look..."
Seymour Skinner,You can't break us up. We're like a family here.
Seymour Skinner,Fifty dollars! I can buy paint for the art class instead of crushed-up berries I find in the woods!
Seymour Skinner,She's the only Springfield Elementary alum ever to advance to the Ivy League!
Seymour Skinner,Buying those extra trophies from cash-strapped schools really filled out the old case.
Seymour Skinner,Oh indeed. Your mother was as fine a student as you.
Seymour Skinner,Keep up the good work and you'll probably wind up just like her.
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, one of the hardest jobs I have is throwing cold water on young children's dreams."
Seymour Skinner,"The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well Bart, I guess his parking spot is yours now."
Seymour Skinner,Every day since we broke up is the greatest day of my life.
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Bart has been very sad lately."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks."
Seymour Skinner,"I mean, take a look at this. If anything, I was wondering if you could make him sadder."
Seymour Skinner,"Marge, Homer, this marital discord is perfect. But please, save it for home where your son could see it."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, if they do this regularly, maybe it could count as gym."
Seymour Skinner,We haven't met... but something terrible has happened... You misfiled the... permission slips. You keep the green... I need the white...
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, well. I might have a crush on the music sub, Ms. Juniper."
Seymour Skinner,"Simpson, here's my plan. Ms. Juniper is divorced, and her daughter Melody is in the third grade."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, if you took ""space case"" on a date... and brought me to chaperone along with her mother..."
Seymour Skinner,"No, if... if the state finds out they'll shut us down!"
Seymour Skinner,"You know, passion has always been a passion of mine."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, something else about me is that I'm thinking of becoming an excellent cook."
Seymour Skinner,I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE / NOT LITERALLY / IT MEANS THAT I'M HAPPY / POST-COITALLY / IT WAS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT!
Seymour Skinner,"Thanks to you, Melody's mother is so upset, she's moving them out of town!"
Seymour Skinner,"Calliope, is there anything I can say to make you stay?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it, it, uh... took place in a country we teach about."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it could have been a day, it could have been the rest of my life."
Seymour Skinner,One thing -- what if there's a woman we both like?
Seymour Skinner,What if I see her hand at the same time you see her face?
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, eyewitnesses to your fight described you as ""berserkoid,"" ""totally aggro,"" and said you punched Milhouse ""like fifty billion times."" That's an excessive number of times."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, I hope we all have a pleasant and orderly day here at ""Satan's Anvil."" No one knows why the early settlers called it that, and I suppose we never will."
Seymour Skinner,"And the one year I didn't, I was bitten by an actual rattlesnake."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, we have to go. Milhouse found a hippie skeleton and he's freaking out."
Seymour Skinner,"If you go on a field trip, don't break off from the group."
Seymour Skinner,"I am your substitute teacher, Sister Mary Elephant. Class, attention, attention, class, class -- shut up! Thank you."
Seymour Skinner,Really? But Sister Mary's no-nonsense attitude is what inspired me to become an educator.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I guess as long as I fold it afterward and don't display it at night... Oh, perhaps I should improvise, or ""do an improv?"""
Seymour Skinner,"A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... the celery phone! Hello? Hello?"
Seymour Skinner,"Mother, how did you get this number -- it's a prop phone! Yes, I have your celery... I took the limpest stalk there was!"
Seymour Skinner,I don't know what to think about milk cans anymore.
Seymour Skinner,"Nelson, either tell them what they're having for lunch, or get off the P.A."
Seymour Skinner,"Mother, I have work to do. Well, it's work if they pay you! They say they're going to!"
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I know every moldy inch of this unaccredited school. But I have never seen such a thing as you describe."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, Lisa... go home, relax, try to do some kid things. You know, with a ball or something... or decorate your sneakers with a ""Magic""-brand marker."
Seymour Skinner,And nothing to hide. I'll just take that key back now.
Seymour Skinner,"Sir, this bus is too heavy to cross the ice bridge. They'll have to take a more circuitous route."
Seymour Skinner,I suppose you want to know why this all happened. Picture what I'm describing in your minds.
Seymour Skinner,"Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry."
Seymour Skinner,"If we didn't get them back by five, we'd be charged for the extra day."
Seymour Skinner,"We planned for the wedding cake, we just didn't see the baby thing coming."
Seymour Skinner,"Well done, the band. We're all bursting with pride after our girls' basketball team beat Shelbyville two-nothing in triple overtime! Now let's make some noise!!! Using our INSIDE VOICES!"
Seymour Skinner,No team? I guess I just have to give you all an hour of free play.
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, control your student! He's ruined more assemblies than the afternoon sun in the west window!"
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
Seymour Skinner,"We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room."
Seymour Skinner,Now wait just a minute! How come I wasn't an option in this contest?
Seymour Skinner,"And now it's time for lights, camera, auction! No cameras!"
Seymour Skinner,"Ooh, first item up for bid is... always a favorite, lunch with Principal Skinner!"
Seymour Skinner,I'll just leave the food on your doorstep and ring the bell.
Seymour Skinner,Moving on. Next up for auction is this wonderful bench hand-crafted by our second-grade class.
Seymour Skinner,Hello? Calling from England? Certainly I can put you on speakerphone.
Seymour Skinner,Sold! To the mysterious and unverified Mrs. Knickertwist! Next item: our school band will play at a function of your choice!
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it looks like our model solar-system will finally get an Earth!"
Seymour Skinner,"...annnd that concludes tonight's auction, which has raised a school record one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars!"
Seymour Skinner,And our windfall is all thanks to our dear new friend on the phone.
Seymour Skinner,Why do I believe everything I hear in a British accent?
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. Simpson, I know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt."
Seymour Skinner,"I said, I'm lop-shouldered! And I have been since I was hung by my armpits in a North Vietnamese prison!"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh the list of things you don't know could fill a week's worth of morning announcements, with enough left over for a send-home flyer!"
Seymour Skinner,"If you think it's so easy to handle Bart Simpson, why don't you do it yourself?!"
Seymour Skinner,"While I'm on a roll I'm gonna call that carpet cleaning service and tell them our hallway doesn't count as a room! Hello, is AndrÃ© there? Oh yes, I'll hold!"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, open this door now -- or I will jiggle the handle indefinitely!"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh my God! We've got a thirty-year mortgage on that photocopier! Willie, stay your tractor!"
Seymour Skinner,"What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels."
Seymour Skinner,"...for creating a furry robotic friend who provides comfort when humans fail to, which they will, trust me."
Seymour Skinner,"And they're set at a place kids relate to. Say, a school."
Seymour Skinner,"No thanks, gentlemen, I've got a nice quiet life here, and I mean to keep it that way."
Seymour Skinner,Trolls live under bridges -- the school should be under a bridge! The Brooklyn Bridge!
Seymour Skinner,"""...and so, Lucinda placed the fifth shard in the stained-glass window, which now clearly read: 'your parents are alive.' Gregor turned to his twin sister and they both understood: their journey was just beginning. The end."""
Seymour Skinner,They can't do this to us -- we've gotta fight back!
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, remember the thousand-year war between the trolls and the ogres?"
Seymour Skinner,"This is the Fuzzlepitch Finals, and tonight, we drink from the Wazzle Cup!"
Seymour Skinner,"No, of course you didn't. The establishment I work for delivers pizzas to everyone, and then gives the customer the option of accepting or refusing delivery."
Seymour Skinner,Doggone it. I'm less popular than the hornet's nest in the gym.
Seymour Skinner,I'm sure someone will come back to tell me where they went. If I go inside they might not find me.
Seymour Skinner,"Attention, students. In order to cut down on the rash of embarrassing YouTube videos of our teachers, we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones."
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, as the runner-up in the race for your heart, I would like to make a toast."
Seymour Skinner,"My Dearest, let me be the first to offer you the hearty handshake that would've climaxed our own wedding day--"
Seymour Skinner,I tied them together with used dental floss as per your memo!
Seymour Skinner,"Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study. This assembly will remedy that."
Seymour Skinner,"We've invited a few friends over to give you some ""musical cues."""
Seymour Skinner,They still have to sign their names properly so we're not totally out of the woods.
Seymour Skinner,"Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular ""Popularity Awards"" -- the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers! No way that can go wrong! First up, Campus Clown..."
Seymour Skinner,"And now the award for ""Least Popular Student."" Lisa Simpson!"
Seymour Skinner,"You probably should accept it, Lisa. They'll go easier on you if you do."
Seymour Skinner,"I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths."
Seymour Skinner,"Only one person I've ever known uses these: my predecessor, Principal Meredith Milgram."
Seymour Skinner,"Follow me, but be warned: there's no permission slip for what we're doing."
Seymour Skinner,Taking four children across town to investigate a piece of paper we found on the ground.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, we do not. Outmoded, no room in the budget, and all the teachers forgot how to make a capital ""Q."""
Seymour Skinner,"Whoa. Howdy, pardners, I'm much obliged to y'all for comin' out to the ol' corral here--"
Seymour Skinner,"Fine, we'll start the raffle and skip the things no one wants, like art projects by your children."
Seymour Skinner,So let's get right to the item I'm sure you're waiting for: the latest Mapple MyPad!
Seymour Skinner,"So you're saying if our kids don't pass this test, you're shutting down Springfield Elementary?"
Seymour Skinner,Why did you say that to us in the meanest way you could?
Seymour Skinner,"We tried to have ourselves accredited as one, but no one here could... draw the pirate."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, Groundskeeper Willie will direct you to your new school district. Any correlation to your talents, needs or friends is completely coincidental."
Seymour Skinner,I have an aunt named Hope. Perhaps you'd like to kill her as well.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I guess a little circular grinding might relax me."
Seymour Skinner,"Let me make this crystal clear to you, Simpson, if you don't pass this test, it will destroy the school."
Seymour Skinner,Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. We've got to get you more time to study. But how?
Seymour Skinner,"Children, remain calm... find your disaster buddy... which is different from your lab partner, but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy."
Seymour Skinner,Save your analogies for the analogy portion of the exam.
Seymour Skinner,It would actually be the only meat in said Joe.
Seymour Skinner,"I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch ""yes."""
Seymour Skinner,"Children, you can stop writing letters of support to our troops. That was just busy-work."
Seymour Skinner,Now I want to explain Miss Hoover's absence. She is suffering from severe depression.
Seymour Skinner,"Not to worry, she has been treated with heavy doses of...Lorazepam and other drugs from the...Benzodiazepine family."
Seymour Skinner,"Now until Miss Hoover returns, this class will be getting a permanent substitute."
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, without corporate sponsorship, we wouldn't be able to teach you the three R's: reading, refreshment and Raspberry Buzz Lite. Get your razz on!"
Seymour Skinner,"Meet your new teacher, Ms. Cantwell. Do not call her by the obvious dirty nickname. Now I must meet with the new art teacher Mr. Testaclese."
Seymour Skinner,"You should never tell on a bully, Lisa. Everyone knows that."
Seymour Skinner,You showed up before the students! That's all we asked!
Seymour Skinner,"I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of ""Rubber v. Glue"" and reaffirmed by ""I Know You Are v. What Am I."""
Seymour Skinner,"Over the next few days, you're going to hear how the defendant, Bartholomew Simpson, a/k/a the ""Springfield Egger..."""
Seymour Skinner,...how Bartholomew Simpson wantonly egged this town with Milhouse aforethought.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh God, the press is gonna have a field day with this."
Seymour Skinner,"You'd make up any lie for that Simpson boy, wouldn't you?"
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. Szyslak, what name did the defendant ask for when he called you at your bar?"
Seymour Skinner,Certainly not I. It would change the way my suits fit.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I am gonna write a note back to Mr. Muntz."
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry about that. So, Mrs. Simpson, the reason you're here..."
Seymour Skinner,"Today, I am not here to talk about what he did. I'm here to talk about the future."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of internet chatter. I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive."
Seymour Skinner,What if Bart took music lessons? Music lessons could channel his destructive impulses into artistic expression. I myself have been taking flamenco lessons.
Seymour Skinner,"I assure you, we've spared no effort to accommodate your special-needs student."
Seymour Skinner,You wait here while I go get the jumper cables.
Seymour Skinner,"So, Kent, what brings you here? The miraculous tale of how we lost, then found, our Lost and Found box?"
Seymour Skinner,I thought this was a puff piece! You're wearing a sweater!
Seymour Skinner,"No, do not make room! Except for Mr. Largo and his diet, there is no cheating in this school."
Seymour Skinner,Please don't air this. I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance -- you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k-ball.
Seymour Skinner,"Please, calm down, everyone! You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity... to, uh, initiate a dialogue... that would, uh, create a teachable moment... uh, something something buzz word, I got nothing."
Seymour Skinner,I did it! I saved the day! The same way I won that battle in Vietnam! By fainting!
Seymour Skinner,It's amazing. Every day has the peace and serenity of a flu outbreak.
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out. So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin."
Seymour Skinner,"It's called ""precipitation,"" because it never fails to precipitate unruly behavior."
Seymour Skinner,"I must say, Lisa, it was amusing to see you thoroughly de-high-horsed."
Seymour Skinner,Good morning. We have completed the tally of the votes for Class Representative.
Seymour Skinner,"One brief announcement, the tainted Greek salad has given several students nightmares involving Michael Dukakis."
Seymour Skinner,"It may recur tonight, so if possible, have your parents strap you to the bed."
Seymour Skinner,And now the results. First Grade Rep: results delayed indefinitely due to jelly on the ballots. Second Grade Rep: Isabel GutiÃ©rrez.
Seymour Skinner,"Third Grade Rep, no votes cast. Fourth Grade Rep, last name Wiener, first name, Ima... Simpson!"
Seymour Skinner,"I'm here to tell you about a field trip so amazing we've put ""sign here"" stickers on the permission slips."
Seymour Skinner,"As you recall these stickers came from last year's field trip to the ""sign here"" sticker factory. But thanks to my old navy buddy -- we both love to shop at Old Navy...the students of this school will be taking a ride on a nuclear-powered, attack-class submarine -- the U.S.S. Tom Clancy!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well that's too bad, because many of you will not be going."
Seymour Skinner,"There is limited room on the submarine, so only the best-behaved students...as determined by me...will go on the trip."
Seymour Skinner,"To increase the tension, everyone starts with a clean slate. But from this moment on..."
Seymour Skinner,"Pranks, inside use of outside voice, off-color whistling, and you're stricken from the list. And once crossed off, you stay crossed off. That's what pens do."
Seymour Skinner,I've broken a ten-year-old's spirit. Time to celebrate... with a fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt.
Seymour Skinner,"No, mother, I did not use any of your talc. I don't know why the bottle feels lighter. Maybe you're just getting stronger!"
Seymour Skinner,"Nice job, Simpson. You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player. She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band."
Seymour Skinner,I'll be right there! Just saying goodbye to mother! Seymour! I'm going out for a walk! See you in several months at the soonest!
Seymour Skinner,"All right, I'll come clean. I woke up and, surprisingly, mother wasn't there beside me. She was dead."
Seymour Skinner,If this were a movie mother wouldn't let me watch it.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, come on. I don't look anything like this... ""Dick Fiddler."""
Seymour Skinner,"I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes?"
Seymour Skinner,"Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done. I accept that I killed my mother. My whole life she's belittled me! Maybe deep down... I'm glad."
Seymour Skinner,Can the Esperanto Society be far behind? I mean... Äˆu la Esperanto-Societo esti multe malantaÅ­?
Seymour Skinner,One of our brightest and most meddlesome students called this meeting... somehow... to discuss an urgent menu matter. Lisa?
Seymour Skinner,"And now in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when I typed in ""G.M.O."" plus ""danger"" plus ""question mark""."
Seymour Skinner,"Children, you're in for a treat. Today's assembly is devoted to a special kind of history."
Seymour Skinner,"Illinois! Eighteen fifty-eight! Please welcome, here to debate the important issues of the day, Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln!"
Seymour Skinner,"A contest? But, sir, we don't have any money to pay for prizes. We had to rent out our multi-purpose room to a Japanese-American social club."
Seymour Skinner,"So, from now on our cafeteria will only serve... delicious ""Stuffwich's"" heroes, hoagies, and torpedoes."
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such as yourself will go hungry. Now please welcome the star of ""Stuffwich's"" ads, who lost four hundred pounds eating only ""Stuffwich"" subs -- Ezra."
Seymour Skinner,"People, please! Martin has left the building. He had an orthodontist appointment."
Seymour Skinner,Lisa? Lisa Simpson? You have ten seconds to get to the podium!
Seymour Skinner,"Our final contestant is Lisa Simpson, who was last seen leaving in tears."
Seymour Skinner,"And with that tardiness, you have at last crossed the boundary where I can legally apply physical discipline."
Seymour Skinner,"Skate! Skate! As fast as you can. / But I'll catch you, I'm the Principal Man! That's the kind of education you're missing."
Seymour Skinner,Oh no! Uphill! The one place my car can't go.
Seymour Skinner,"You will take art, you will enjoy art, and you will make something in a kiln your mother can use."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth graders. Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail."
Seymour Skinner,"The eggs are supposed to be tossed between students, not at the principal. Once more and hurl!"
Seymour Skinner,"Look, do you want this to be your last school memory?"
Seymour Skinner,I'll bet your biggest hurdle was leaving your beloved hometown.
Seymour Skinner,...spreading the rumor that today's lunch would be served by a naked lady...
Seymour Skinner,"There's no hope for you, Simpson. You'll be locked in detention until you graduate to the penal system."
Seymour Skinner,"Students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield Time Capsule...where your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first century...and..."
Seymour Skinner,"How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something."
Seymour Skinner,"So, Mr. Lassen, you began your career at Shelbyville Prep."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I see you're left-handed... so that concludes my evaluation. Enjoy fourth grade."
Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to ""Bring Us Your Toilet Paper"" night. Don't worry, none goes to Willie."
Seymour Skinner,"It's a comic strip I do called ""Bumble and Grumble."" Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son."
Seymour Skinner,"Wasn't that wonderful? And now, ""Santas of Many Lands,"" as presented by the entire second grade class."
Seymour Skinner,"The fourth grade will now favor us with a melody, medley of holiday flavorites."
Seymour Skinner,"The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol""."
Seymour Skinner,"You, there! No chewing gum on school grounds. In the trash can with it!"
Seymour Skinner,"Simpson, you and I are going to have a little talk."
Seymour Skinner,"I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill."
Seymour Skinner,"By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to..."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision --"
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor."
Seymour Skinner,"Hello, kids. Everything above the board here? Good. Play friendly, children."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, oh. There's your bell. Come along now, all of you."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, no no no. He'll get you after school, son. Now hurry up. It's time for class."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, the school nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his little face after the fight. Goodbye, son. I guess you were right. All that homework was a waste of your time."
Seymour Skinner,"People, people, no rough-housing on the monkey bars. You there, tuck in your shirt. Watch it, I saw that."
Seymour Skinner,"Well Mother, I would like you to meet, Milhouse, Lewis, Richard and... Bart Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,"Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today."
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory."
Seymour Skinner,"Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatory making use of the facilities."
Seymour Skinner,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away."
Seymour Skinner,"Actually, he'd be staying in France in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks."
Seymour Skinner,I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian."
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea."
Seymour Skinner,"You may find his accent peculiar. Certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I urge you all to give little Adil the benefit of the doubt. In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world."
Seymour Skinner,"People let's have good assembly manners. People, people. Quiet down, now, please. Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents and music lovers. Welcome to the first in a series of Saturday evening concerts."
Seymour Skinner,"Gentlemen, according to my sources you are planning to simultaneously drop your pencils at 2:15 this afternoon. Do so and you will be suspended."
Seymour Skinner,"Say what they will about our cafeteria, I-I still think they're the best Tater Tots money can buy."
Seymour Skinner,Wait a minute... that smells like sodium tetrasulfate bonding with chlorophyll!
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm flabbergasted. Surely you knew, as you were writing your own name in forty-foot-high letters in the field, that you would be caught."
Seymour Skinner,The sheer contempt demonstrated by this incident makes me wish I could pull the trusty board of education out of retirement.
Seymour Skinner,I think the real question is who is this and where is Homer Simpson?
Seymour Skinner,"I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace. I'd be delighted!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well thank you, Bart. I only hope that for the next few hours you and I can leave our differences in the schoolyard."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, Simpson. I-I had a discomforting thought on the way over here. This dinner wouldn't be a master plan of yours to set me up with some unmarried relation? Because I can assure you that..."
Seymour Skinner,"So Patty, tell me more about your trip to Egypt."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, yes. I've heard they can be difficult. Patty, the Parents Advisory Board has asked that I attend the premiere of Space Mutants Part 5 tomorrow night. Would you be interested in joining me?"
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you wouldn't happen to know what sort of candy your Aunt Patty likes, would you?"
Seymour Skinner,"Very good. Now then, regarding your punishment... do you feel that you've learned your lesson?"
Seymour Skinner,"""Two and Two are Four, Four and Four are Eight, Eight and Eight are Sixteen..."""
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, excellent suggestion. I suggest we start with The Springfield Revolving Restaurant. You know, food tastes better when you're revolving."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, well, well. If it isn't little Jimmy Pearson. Class of '71 I believe."
Seymour Skinner,"Pearson, get this woman a glass of water, immediately! And tuck in your shirt."
Seymour Skinner,Nearly thirty and still working as a busboy. Standardized testing never lies.
Seymour Skinner,"I wish I could make a P.A. announcement to the whole world. Attention, everyone: Seymour Skinner is in love!"
Seymour Skinner,"Ah... Bart, I hate to pull you away from your daily exercise, but ... well..."
Seymour Skinner,I wanted you to be the first to know. I'm going to ask for your Aunt Patty's hand in marriage.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, well there's something up here that will pick up your spirit."
Seymour Skinner,"It's the second most precious jewel in this bell tower. Patty, the question before you is will you marry me?"
Seymour Skinner,... that you couldn't leave your sister for any man. Oh.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Springfield Elementary! I will have you back again! After all, tomorrow is another school day!"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,"
Seymour Skinner,"Malignant spirochetes infest your bloodstream, eventually spreading to your spinal fluid, and on into the brain."
Seymour Skinner,"Well now, children, here we are, open your primers to page 32."
Seymour Skinner,"No children, your not seeing things, this, my little friends, is a schwa."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, all right. Play friendly with your new teacher, children!"
