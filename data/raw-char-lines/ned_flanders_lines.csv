Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Ned Flanders,"Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!"
Ned Flanders,"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
Ned Flanders,Fee fi fo fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simp-son! Mmmm- mmm!
Ned Flanders,"Friends, we love you all, but I also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being Latin for ""left-handed."" But enough joking."
Ned Flanders,"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
Ned Flanders,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"
Ned Flanders,"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
Ned Flanders,"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
Ned Flanders,"No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend."
Ned Flanders,For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
Ned Flanders,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Ned Flanders,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, indeedily-doodily. I've even been in ""Streetcar"" once before. I played Blanche DuBois! Hmmm huh. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
Ned Flanders,"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
Ned Flanders,STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
Ned Flanders,"And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr..."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" Volumes One, Two and Four."
Ned Flanders,"IF YOU THINK I'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH..."
Ned Flanders,It's been four thousand days since my last drink. It was my first and last Blackberry schnapps.
Ned Flanders,"I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the day, but I'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
Ned Flanders,"Well it's Bart Simpson! C'mon in! You're just in time for ""Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!"""
Ned Flanders,"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
Ned Flanders,"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
Ned Flanders,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
Ned Flanders,"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
Ned Flanders,"That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
Ned Flanders,"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. Oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it on my income tax?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
Ned Flanders,"Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
Ned Flanders,"...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend."
Ned Flanders,"Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
Ned Flanders,But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
Ned Flanders,"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
Ned Flanders,"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
Ned Flanders,I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
Ned Flanders,"All right. It's true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I see by the big board we've got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation."
Ned Flanders,"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
Ned Flanders,"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
Ned Flanders,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
Ned Flanders,"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE..."
Ned Flanders,"WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL / I ASKED MY MOTHER WHAT WILL I BE / WILL I BE PRETTY, WILL I BE RICH? / HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID TO ME..."
Ned Flanders,Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.
Ned Flanders,"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
Ned Flanders,"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
Ned Flanders,"Let's see. ""Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess I am putting up the Halloweenie decorations a little early. Criticism accepted."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, okay folks, look. I called the Police Captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
Ned Flanders,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
Ned Flanders,Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch ""My Three Sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
Ned Flanders,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU."
Ned Flanders,"Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment..."
Ned Flanders,"No, Son, we've got to let Bart and Lisa get one. C'mon, this one's easy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!"
Ned Flanders,Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
Ned Flanders,"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's JosÃ© Flanders..."
Ned Flanders,"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
Ned Flanders,Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
Ned Flanders,"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
Ned Flanders,"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdily-Doodily there, President Bush--or should I say President Neighbor! I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd."
Ned Flanders,"Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!"
Ned Flanders,"Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy. Nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog."
Ned Flanders,Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
Ned Flanders,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
Ned Flanders,"Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?"
Ned Flanders,"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
Ned Flanders,"If it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! If it's tangy and brown, you're in Cider Town! Now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
Ned Flanders,"...Adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. And, of course, in Canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. Could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra."
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- Uh, I... I kinda feel like Job."
Ned Flanders,"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. What more could I do? I... I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I... I... I just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. I... I...I..."
Ned Flanders,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
Ned Flanders,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
Ned Flanders,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
Ned Flanders,"Oh yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you -- I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk."
Ned Flanders,I attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself.
Ned Flanders,"No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. Y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they've got those machines in the lobby. They're even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Lousy beatniks! Hey, that felt good!"
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"
Ned Flanders,"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy and Chimpy I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
Ned Flanders,"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I... I think they could start slacking at any moment."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Marge, I... I appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... Well, they... they're a lot worse."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, it's Ned Flanders. The teens have been chasing me all night. They finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
Ned Flanders,"All right, Wildcats! Are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
Ned Flanders,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
Ned Flanders,"Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, nothing's perfect, I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my-diddily-i. Will you look at this place! And the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
Ned Flanders,"Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi, Marge. Heh-heh. Guess we gave you quite a start. We were painting Todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. Must've dozed off."
Ned Flanders,"Ahh, of course! This must be where he dropped the dagger. And this is the butler's pantry where Mrs. Astor concealed herself. And right here's where they found the torso heap! In front of our very own fireplace!"
Ned Flanders,"We appreciate the offer, Marge, but I think we're going to be very happy here."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
Ned Flanders,"You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer. But I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
Ned Flanders,"Hmmm. Let's see, cash-register ink. Well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? Mmm... But then I do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, why, everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine. And let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', God bless 'em."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
Ned Flanders,"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady Neddy."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. And some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. I'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a--"
Ned Flanders,In the bathroom. Not trimmin' my mustache. Whaddaya think? Do I remind you of troubled troubadour David Crosby?
Ned Flanders,"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town!"
Ned Flanders,"No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed."
Ned Flanders,"God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but I just don't feel right ab... Oh, Lord, what should I do?"
Ned Flanders,"How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""?"
Ned Flanders,"I'll have a Shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... Oh, what the heck, you only live once. Give me a..."
Ned Flanders,"Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program."
Ned Flanders,"What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!"
Ned Flanders,"I don't want to be a Panicky Pete, but it's Sunday and I haven't been to church yet."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
Ned Flanders,"Leapin' Lazarus! Is this what passes for eternal rest these days? Rod, go get Daddy his buryin' shovel."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
Ned Flanders,"And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?"
Ned Flanders,Everything but the opinion page! I don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
Ned Flanders,"Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door."
Ned Flanders,He taught us how to live a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar.
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
Ned Flanders,I move we reconsider our club name. Make it something a little less blasphemous. After all we don't want to go to Hell.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hm. That's the one! They've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. Ooh, cost us a bundle, too. I guess we'll have an ""Imagination Christmas"" this year."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that safety gear. Helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
Ned Flanders,"Abso-not-ly, hot Roddy. We're up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers' cussing."
Ned Flanders,"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
Ned Flanders,"If I'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, you're right. I've just got to work through the grief. There's not gonna be an easy answer."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but I feel like I've turned a corner."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? It just feels way too soon."
Ned Flanders,"Well, with triple word score, that's ninety! Ha-ha, I guess my luck is starting to even out."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm. Dinner was delicious, Edna, but I can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get Principal Skinner jealous."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I just can't relate to the women of today, Homer. Ah, it's probably me. I'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, I never question you... but I've been wondering if your decision to take Maude was, well, wrong... Unless this is part of your divine plan... Could you just give me some kinda sign? Anything? And after all that church chocolate I bought. Which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. Well, I've had it."
Ned Flanders,"No, I'm not kidding. I am gonna sit right here and miss church. You just watch."
Ned Flanders,"Maybe we can. My name's Ned Flanders, and I'm here every week. Rain or shine."
Ned Flanders,"Ah yeah, I never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. It was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
Ned Flanders,I'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that Hollywood hogwash.
Ned Flanders,"""They're Controlling Our Minds With Flu Shots?!"" I knew it. Well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll just reimburse you right n-- Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot like that movie, ""Paper Moon."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. This one's fine and dandy, Roddy. It's approved by a council of Presbylutheran ministers."
Ned Flanders,"We'll just see about that-- Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake-- Nope. It's airtight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, in that case... My neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape in my house. It's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor."
Ned Flanders,...and Harry Potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
Ned Flanders,"Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on."
Ned Flanders,"I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
Ned Flanders,"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
Ned Flanders,"No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
Ned Flanders,"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been closed for so long... and-and I thought I could turn it into a Christian theme park."
Ned Flanders,"If you could do that, I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
Ned Flanders,"Morning, Kent. Our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. We're gonna show Springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, what can I get you, little Christian? How 'bout a Noah's Ark of Jellies?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see..."
Ned Flanders,"Hello, Gas Company? How poisonous is your gas?... Wow. But-- Eh, but I'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... How could that be worse?... Okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... I see."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, I need to ask ya a favor. My baby sitter canceled and I got tickets to a Christian rock concert."
Ned Flanders,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. Anyway, thanks again."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
Ned Flanders,"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
Ned Flanders,"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
Ned Flanders,"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, I know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. But, uh, I know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so I will."
Ned Flanders,Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. It's the best darn diddly way to start your first Flanders day!
Ned Flanders,"Whoops. Watch the swears, Honey Bear. We don't use the ""I"" word in this house."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, hey, now hold on there. The nice people want to hear the real words."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Here's a preview. GOD SAID TO NOAH / BUILD YOURSELF AN ARK-Y ARK-Y / ANIMALS CAME ON BY ONES AND TWOSIES, TWOSIES / ELEPHANTS AND KANGAROOSIES - ROOSIES..."
Ned Flanders,"I don't know, neighboreenos, I'm all for Halloween fun, but a sÃ©ance sounds a little PG-13."
Ned Flanders,"Say Homer, I was, uh, I was wondering if I could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me."
Ned Flanders,"Boy, that's Jim Dandy roof candy! I'd love to come over some time and watch that Church Channel."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you'd win that bet. Seems like I'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. Or as I like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
Ned Flanders,"Mm hmm! Open as a tomb on Easter. Now, what can I ding dong diddily do for ya?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I should say not. I gave up on L.A. when those TV people made that poor nun fly. All those Puerto Ricans lookin' up her dress. That's not right."
Ned Flanders,"I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
Ned Flanders,"A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon."
Ned Flanders,WELL I'VE GOT A DATE WITH A GIRL WITH NO NAME / IT SURE FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE GAME / AT DESSERT MAYBE I CAN ASK HER HER NAME / 'CAUSE I CAN'T PRAY FOR HER WITHOUT THE RIGHT NAME...
Ned Flanders,Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett."
Ned Flanders,"... Rod says ""Marco,"" and darn it if Todd doesn't say ""Polo"" right back! Oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. You're probably bored silly."
Ned Flanders,"Yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between Los Angeles and New York. Called America!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least I can do."
Ned Flanders,Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble.
Ned Flanders,"So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically."
Ned Flanders,Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a casket.
Ned Flanders,"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
Ned Flanders,"Sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Siegfried and Roy create a lot of illusions, but I doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" You know, the cow being me."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
Ned Flanders,It says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. And that's good enough for me.
Ned Flanders,Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
Ned Flanders,"I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
Ned Flanders,You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
Ned Flanders,"THEN I DOUBT YOU'LL LIKE NED FLANDERS / OR HIS CREEPY LITTLE OFFSPRING, ROD AND TODD..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
Ned Flanders,Scared of what? All the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? WE'LL BE SAFE INSIDE OUR FORTRESS WHEN THEY COME / WE'LL BE SAFE FROM CREEPS AND KILLERS WHEN THEY COME / UNLESS THEY HAVE A BLOWTORCH / OR A POISON GAS INJECTOR / THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN THEY COME!
Ned Flanders,Of course I am. They were bigger than Jesus! But your boy went Yoko and broke up my collection.
Ned Flanders,Oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. The only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. What these boys need is adult supervision.
Ned Flanders,"I'm dying! And there's Heaven. But who's that? Confucius? And Milton Berle? Boy, have I been barkin' up the wrong tree."
Ned Flanders,"Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?"
Ned Flanders,"Why, I'll give you a jump, I'll rotate your tires, I'll even fold up that map for you. I know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
Ned Flanders,That tears it. I'll show Homer. I'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually, I picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
Ned Flanders,"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
Ned Flanders,"""And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
Ned Flanders,"They were two for one at Krusty Home Depot, so I got an extra one for you guys!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box."
Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Ned. Just because you foresaw Dr. Hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. It was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three."
Ned Flanders,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
Ned Flanders,"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."
Ned Flanders,"Well, my Roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
Ned Flanders,"Let's see... ""Get Bent."" Well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. We'll take the whole box. Get bent, everyone!"
Ned Flanders,"Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
Ned Flanders,"Not that convenience store crap, is it? Because I don't feed that to my dogs."
Ned Flanders,"There's nothing but filth on TV. But with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
Ned Flanders,"Now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of Cain and Abel!"
Ned Flanders,"Your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! Now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
Ned Flanders,"Boys, I just talked to God. He's vacuuming Heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. And He'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
Ned Flanders,"Now I must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
Ned Flanders,"Now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. We can put the sound in later."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I-I guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal European wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of Miss Ashley Judd!"
Ned Flanders,"Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message."
Ned Flanders,Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.
Ned Flanders,"""So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them... Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the Earth. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between God and man."" Thank you."
Ned Flanders,"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him."
Ned Flanders,"Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."
Ned Flanders,"He scampered out of Parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't take money from a neighbor. Although, business at the Leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it might be fun to be a landlord. Landfella -- there's only one Lord!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... Now, do you have any pets?"
Ned Flanders,"You poor thing! I've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. Girls, welcome to your very own Ned and Breakfast."
Ned Flanders,You soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. And sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
Ned Flanders,The whole town is laughing at me behind my back. I guess you're the only real friend I have.
Ned Flanders,"The Bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Toddy, you know how I said our friends are like the Canaanites? Today I realized they're more like the Midianites."
Ned Flanders,I wish we lived in a place more like the America of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us Republicans.
Ned Flanders,"""Made in Humbleton, PA."" I don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that I bought at a garage sale. But corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
Ned Flanders,The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
Ned Flanders,This town is sweeter than a cake made of pie. Even the dogs curb themselves.
Ned Flanders,You know what? I'm not gonna. My mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's really touching. But my boys and I are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
Ned Flanders,"Now coach, I've tried to be Christian and respectful, but I guess I'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. Legally, I still own this house."
Ned Flanders,It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
Ned Flanders,Bart and Homer can't go Catholic! The Romans have been separate from us since the Schism of Lourdes in 1573. And that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. Which we've since abolished.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip."
Ned Flanders,He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
Ned Flanders,Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
Ned Flanders,"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
Ned Flanders,"Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,You want me to deliver the Christmas sermon? I feel like I'm born again again!
Ned Flanders,HOW I LOVE MY COAT OF MANY COLORS / IT WAS RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / AND SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH / AND RUBY AND OLIVE AND VIOLET AND FAWN...
Ned Flanders,...AND LILAC AND GOLD AND CHOCOLATE AND MAUVE / AND CREAM AND CRIMSON AND SILVER AND ROSE / AND AZURE AND LEMON AND RUSSET AND GREY...
Ned Flanders,AND PURPLE AND WHITE AND PINK AND ORANGE / AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH...
Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, we could do a little Quid Pro for the Kay-Pro. The left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of Springfield's largest southpaw shop, I just gotta be there. Could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
Ned Flanders,"Here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, wow, it's the Big Unit himself, Randy Johnson! You've fanned more men than Salome!"
Ned Flanders,"It's the ripcord from a Band-Aid wrapper! Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
Ned Flanders,I just can't. They're all I've got since that sad day when Maude found eternal happiness.
Ned Flanders,"I'm not Ned, I'm a friendly dog. Oh, I'm not a good liar. I did come here to check on the... where's Rod?"
Ned Flanders,"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM / I'LL MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN / WHEN PLAYTIME IS A SAFE TIME, EVERYBODY WINS..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
Ned Flanders,"Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle. All diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
Ned Flanders,"Only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? Well I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! Tell you what, I'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
Ned Flanders,"Tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
Ned Flanders,Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?
Ned Flanders,No one was ever a monkey! Everything is what it was and always will be! God put us here and that's that!
Ned Flanders,They're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. Even though there's nothing about it in the Bible!
Ned Flanders,"I... uh... I got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... I'll just pay it."
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but I just want to thank you for your early Christmas card."
Ned Flanders,"Tonight's G-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! And while you enjoy this quiet riot, I'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
Ned Flanders,"Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
Ned Flanders,Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
Ned Flanders,"This is it, boys -- One more out and we go to the championship game. Let's do it for Groundskeeper Willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
Ned Flanders,"Sixty Minutes -- Morley Safer has questionable pants fold -- ""The L Word"" -- used the ""L"" word."
Ned Flanders,Imploring people I never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. That's what I'm doing!
Ned Flanders,So it is! I'm just here to pay the fine for the Sunday School bus. You towed it with the kids still in it!
Ned Flanders,Welcome to Heck House! You're about to discover what a life of sin will get you!
Ned Flanders,"That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal! Welcome to the club!"
Ned Flanders,"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
Ned Flanders,Um... the battery seems to be dead. I'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
Ned Flanders,"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
Ned Flanders,"Yep, I'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
Ned Flanders,"Young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
Ned Flanders,"Well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
Ned Flanders,Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. And also, thank you for my partner Homer, who..."
Ned Flanders,I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS
Ned Flanders,KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
Ned Flanders,"Forget it! I am turning in my... well, I don't really have anything to turn in. So that's that! I suggest you call Homer Simpson."
Ned Flanders,I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
Ned Flanders,For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!
Ned Flanders,"I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in."
Ned Flanders,"""...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."" Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. ""The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."""
Ned Flanders,...Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.
Ned Flanders,"Wordplay: never cared for it. But it's never too soon for you two to join the ""I do"" crew. Now I'm not sayin' it's all Jell-O with Cool Whip. She'll nag ya. She'll try to change ya. You'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
Ned Flanders,"Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
Ned Flanders,"What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
Ned Flanders,Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
Ned Flanders,"Red Dog, this is Mustache One. We have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
Ned Flanders,Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!
Ned Flanders,So I can rent it back to you. Just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
Ned Flanders,"When I was putting new insulation in your attic, I slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm sorry, I just had my glass of warm milk which means I am closed for business!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
Ned Flanders,"You two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, Christian but not Baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind."
Ned Flanders,I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
Ned Flanders,"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. I found out Rod watched a commercial for ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and Todd took a full day to tell me."
Ned Flanders,"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
Ned Flanders,"Oh Reverend, I've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,"And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. And thank you, again, for the challenge of Homer Simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. Me Homer, you the cross. And now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
Ned Flanders,"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
Ned Flanders,You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
Ned Flanders,"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
Ned Flanders,"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."
Ned Flanders,I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
Ned Flanders,Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me, that's your salad fork!... That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only!... What's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""Happy Birthday?"""
Ned Flanders,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Ned Flanders,"Inspiration Point looks pretty uninspired... All's quiet in Murder Town... Yep, Springfield is cleaner than the Lord's hand towels."
Ned Flanders,But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
Ned Flanders,"I never wanted to turn into Big Brother. I just wanted to be Little Sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
Ned Flanders,That's the worst sin of all for some reason! What can I do to make things right?
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, Marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, God made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
Ned Flanders,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
Ned Flanders,"Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team."
Ned Flanders,"In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just don't like the monster I've become."
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, Mr. Burns! For our half hour I thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
Ned Flanders,Did a volcano erupt in Candyland? 'Cause I just caught me a flyin' red hot!
Ned Flanders,"You know, I don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. Anyhoo, so I don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."
Ned Flanders,"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
Ned Flanders,"Bart Simpson? Why, he lives right next door to me! Yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."
Ned Flanders,"Homer? Yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... I guess. So, what say we have lunch?"
Ned Flanders,"...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
Ned Flanders,"Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
Ned Flanders,"Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but I'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
Ned Flanders,Oh yes they were! We deliberately chose a Doctor Stork so we could say it without lying.
Ned Flanders,"But I think if we hold off for a while, you'll find I'm well worth the wait. Like a mild cheddar I get tangy when I'm sittin' on the shelf."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what the heck. I know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a Ken Burns documentary, but you're that special."
Ned Flanders,"I don't wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote ""CHURCHY JOE"" on my face."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
Ned Flanders,Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
Ned Flanders,"That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time."
Ned Flanders,"Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,Oh I was just wondering how many boxes of staples I should order for the store. Does ten sound like a lot to you? Twenty? Fifty? What does sound like a lot to you?
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it! Edna, call me Delta Airlines 'cause I can't handle your extra baggage."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I had a long walk with Homer Simpson yesterday, and as I was carrying him back home, I had a lot of time to think."
Ned Flanders,I started drinking orange juice with pulp! I asked the Reverend and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
Ned Flanders,"Springfield. My home town. Pretty little place. Although, even the Garden of Eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
Ned Flanders,"All these years I thought murder was a sin. Then, I got new instructions from the good Lord Himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- English."
Ned Flanders,"Patty and Selma?! Sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
Ned Flanders,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been."
Ned Flanders,"It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth."
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
Ned Flanders,"Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, credits include Jesus in the passion play last year, Jesus in the passion play the year before that, Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be -- you guessed it, St. Peter..."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer's givin' it the old bible college try. Maybe I should have dialed down the Doubting Thomas."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, forgive me for my pride. All-wise, as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me."
Ned Flanders,"Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry honey, but I'm stuck in this meeting of the Springfield L.G.B.T. The Left-Gifted, Bidextrous, and Transhanded community. We're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""Left is Right"" parade."
Ned Flanders,This could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. Can you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir... when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili. I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's just great, boys. Now, come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo."
Ned Flanders,"You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! Now, just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?! This marriage isn't perfect!"
Ned Flanders,"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
Ned Flanders,"I just felt so ashamed I just couldn't go home. Today, I gave in to the one thing I vowed I would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
Ned Flanders,"So after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. What do you say, sweetie?"
Ned Flanders,MY MOUSTACHE / IS BRISTLY / MY LETTERS / ARE EPISTLY / AND I DON'T WANNA / MISLEAD YOU / I LIKE TO HUG AND KISSLY--
Ned Flanders,"Well, hello! It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
Ned Flanders,"Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. Darnit, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive!"
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I'm not one for costumes, but I sure do like that feather in your hair."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, God's there, with His little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
Ned Flanders,"I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""The Feud Network"" to ""Comity Central."""
Ned Flanders,Mind if I come over and sweeten your greetin'. Sweeten your greetin'! SWEETEN YOUR GREETIN'!
Ned Flanders,And the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park."
Ned Flanders,There's no emergency here! And please charge us for the false report! I'm going out for a power walk.
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! This is a clip-on!"
Ned Flanders,Was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? That's what I wanna know.
Ned Flanders,"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
Ned Flanders,"You wanna hit me. Well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
Ned Flanders,"You know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? Well, sir, I want you to rid of Lisa's bully teacher."
Ned Flanders,Church songs with clapping... I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
Ned Flanders,I'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
Ned Flanders,Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
Ned Flanders,"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
Ned Flanders,Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
Ned Flanders,Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
Ned Flanders,"Well, we pulled more plugs than a Dutch doctor. Now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
Ned Flanders,Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through."
Ned Flanders,Sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. Are you just buying this to be nice?
Ned Flanders,This is a whole new relationship for us! We'll be friends! In this life and the next!
Ned Flanders,"Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. Our mission is one hundred percent pure."
Ned Flanders,She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
Ned Flanders,"Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
Ned Flanders,"Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
Ned Flanders,"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
Ned Flanders,"Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand."
Ned Flanders,Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Ned Flanders,And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19."
Ned Flanders,"I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now."
Ned Flanders,"All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
Ned Flanders,"All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
Ned Flanders,"All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!"
Ned Flanders,"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh. I wanted to subscribe to that new Arts and Crafts Channel. Well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
