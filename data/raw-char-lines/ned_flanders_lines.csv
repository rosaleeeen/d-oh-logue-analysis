Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Ned Flanders,"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Ned Flanders,"Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!"
Ned Flanders,"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
Ned Flanders,Fee fi fo fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simp-son! Mmmm- mmm!
Ned Flanders,"Friends, we love you all, but I also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being Latin for ""left-handed."" But enough joking."
Ned Flanders,"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
Ned Flanders,"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
Ned Flanders,"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
Ned Flanders,"You must have something you want to wish for, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, don't say. Otherwise it won't come true."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
Ned Flanders,"Now, you put that money away. That was an accident."
Ned Flanders,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
Ned Flanders,Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
Ned Flanders,"Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
Ned Flanders,"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"
Ned Flanders,"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
Ned Flanders,"Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined."
Ned Flanders,"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
Ned Flanders,"No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend."
Ned Flanders,For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
Ned Flanders,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
Ned Flanders,"All right, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
Ned Flanders,"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
Ned Flanders,"He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
Ned Flanders,I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
Ned Flanders,... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug.
Ned Flanders,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, indeedily-doodily. I've even been in ""Streetcar"" once before. I played Blanche DuBois! Hmmm huh. Just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
Ned Flanders,"Hot diggity! How 'bout that, Marge? Li'l ol' Stanley me! ""Stella!"" ""Stella!"" Heh heh."
Ned Flanders,"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
Ned Flanders,STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!
Ned Flanders,The door's frozen shut... and it's the only way out!
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, Christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice. Hey, dig this."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress square and true."
Ned Flanders,"Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar."
Ned Flanders,"Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned."
Ned Flanders,I just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
Ned Flanders,"We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Bart, you met Grandma Flanders. Hope she didn't scare ya."
Ned Flanders,"Heidy-ho, Simpson. Your son shoved this through our doggie door."
Ned Flanders,"And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! Well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
Ned Flanders,"If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" Volumes One, Two and Four."
Ned Flanders,"IF YOU THINK I'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH..."
Ned Flanders,It's been four thousand days since my last drink. It was my first and last Blackberry schnapps.
Ned Flanders,"Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
Ned Flanders,"I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the day, but I'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
Ned Flanders,I can't imagine what we could've done to... Oh... oh no!
Ned Flanders,Oh...the network slogan is true. Watch Fox and be damned for all eternity.
Ned Flanders,"Now, Marge, don't you worry. We've all had our brushes with the law."
Ned Flanders,"Well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?"
Ned Flanders,... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should.
Ned Flanders,"Maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,"Aww, isn't that cute? He's trying to claw my eyes out."
Ned Flanders,"Hey now, Marge. Let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
Ned Flanders,"Well it's Bart Simpson! C'mon in! You're just in time for ""Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!"""
Ned Flanders,"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
Ned Flanders,"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
Ned Flanders,"Here you go, your rubber training knife. You've attained the rank of Pussy Willow."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation."
Ned Flanders,"Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine has already been confirmed."
Ned Flanders,"Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer?"
Ned Flanders,"I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
Ned Flanders,Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought?
Ned Flanders,"Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope."
Ned Flanders,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
Ned Flanders,Here's our chance! Dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
Ned Flanders,"Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily..."
Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
Ned Flanders,"That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
Ned Flanders,You folks got robbed too? The burglar took my Shroud of Turin beach towels.
Ned Flanders,"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
Ned Flanders,"I don't really have very much experience, but I'll be---"
Ned Flanders,"Oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. Oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it on my income tax?"
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
Ned Flanders,"Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again."
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table."
Ned Flanders,"Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch."
Ned Flanders,Sure didilly do. Over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
Ned Flanders,Wait a second. You're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
Ned Flanders,"...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
Ned Flanders,"Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--"
Ned Flanders,We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship."
Ned Flanders,There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer.
Ned Flanders,"Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know?"
Ned Flanders,"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes."
Ned Flanders,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend."
Ned Flanders,"Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
Ned Flanders,Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
Ned Flanders,But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
Ned Flanders,"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
Ned Flanders,"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
Ned Flanders,"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, cockily-Doodily-Doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
Ned Flanders,I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
Ned Flanders,MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB...
Ned Flanders,"All right. It's true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, why that sounds like Gabriel's trumpet. You know what that means, kids?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I see by the big board we've got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation."
Ned Flanders,"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
Ned Flanders,"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Howdilly doodilly neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
Ned Flanders,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, sounds fair. Toodle-oo, everybody. I'll, I'll scream when the comet gets here."
Ned Flanders,"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE..."
Ned Flanders,"WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL / I ASKED MY MOTHER WHAT WILL I BE / WILL I BE PRETTY, WILL I BE RICH? / HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID TO ME..."
Ned Flanders,Is that so? Well gee... maybe the old FlandersMobile could use a...
Ned Flanders,Lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart.
Ned Flanders,Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.
Ned Flanders,"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
Ned Flanders,"Flanders to God, Flanders to God! Get off your cloud and save my Todd."
Ned Flanders,"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa."
Ned Flanders,"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
Ned Flanders,We do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right here.
Ned Flanders,"Let's see. ""Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
Ned Flanders,"Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess I am putting up the Halloweenie decorations a little early. Criticism accepted."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, okay folks, look. I called the Police Captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
Ned Flanders,Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch ""My Three Sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
Ned Flanders,"C'mon, you Gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
Ned Flanders,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU."
Ned Flanders,"Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment..."
Ned Flanders,Okay. For one gold star: What Persian king exempted the Levites from taxation?
Ned Flanders,"No, Son, we've got to let Bart and Lisa get one. C'mon, this one's easy."
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!"
Ned Flanders,Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
Ned Flanders,Reverend... Emergency... I... You... Simpson kids... Eedily... Baptism... Oodily... Doodily-doodily...
Ned Flanders,"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
Ned Flanders,Today we write a new page in the Flanders family bible.
Ned Flanders,Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces?
Ned Flanders,"Rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's JosÃ© Flanders..."
Ned Flanders,"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
Ned Flanders,"Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- I'm stumped."
Ned Flanders,Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
Ned Flanders,"You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous, I didn't mean any disrespect."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts."
Ned Flanders,"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
Ned Flanders,"Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the Neighborhood Association."
Ned Flanders,"Howdily-Doodily there, President Bush--or should I say President Neighbor! I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd."
Ned Flanders,"Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!"
Ned Flanders,"Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--"
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy. Nice to see you there ... on my lawn... with your dog."
Ned Flanders,"Better get the ol' snow shovel back from Homer, huh?"
Ned Flanders,Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
Ned Flanders,Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! Couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. Just promise you'll have a good time."
Ned Flanders,Maude? Boys? Come on up! We're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
Ned Flanders,"Open the door, Maude! I don't have time for the secret knock!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
Ned Flanders,"Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, suckin' down the cider, eh? Hey, word to the wise... season pass!"
Ned Flanders,"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
Ned Flanders,"If it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! If it's tangy and brown, you're in Cider Town! Now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
Ned Flanders,"...Adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. And, of course, in Canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. Could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
Ned Flanders,"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra."
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- Uh, I... I kinda feel like Job."
Ned Flanders,"But Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me?"
Ned Flanders,"Even in my darkest hour, I can turn to the Good Book for..."
Ned Flanders,"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. What more could I do? I... I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I... I... I just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. I... I...I..."
Ned Flanders,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
Ned Flanders,"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
Ned Flanders,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
Ned Flanders,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
Ned Flanders,"Oh yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you -- I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met."
Ned Flanders,I attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly. Could I have another straitjacket?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder! Oops, thanks for dropping by."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
Ned Flanders,"No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. Y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they've got those machines in the lobby. They're even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Lousy beatniks! Hey, that felt good!"
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"
Ned Flanders,"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
Ned Flanders,"THEY'RE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE LORD SAYS LOVE THY NEIGHBOR --"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy and Chimpy I've ever seen."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
Ned Flanders,"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
Ned Flanders,"Well, what do you say, Homer? Can Lisa babysit for my kids?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
Ned Flanders,You did? Just a minute. What time can you come over?
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you're talking about root beer, I plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
Ned Flanders,I'm meek... but I could probably stand to be meeker.
Ned Flanders,"...Well, I... I think I may be coveting my own wife..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I... I think they could start slacking at any moment."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Marge, I... I appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... Well, they... they're a lot worse."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, it's Ned Flanders. The teens have been chasing me all night. They finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
Ned Flanders,Tell Maude I want a fancy funeral. Big coffin. Lotsa jewels.
Ned Flanders,"You saved me, Reverend. You really went above and beyond. Thank you!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
Ned Flanders,"Ex... ex... excuse me, sir? I think you've got my TV. Sir?"
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
Ned Flanders,"Little higher, Wendell... A lot higher, Martin... Ah, Ralph, that's a basketball."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's super-duper, Lisa! In fact, we already have four girls on the team."
Ned Flanders,"All right, Wildcats! Are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
Ned Flanders,Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, I gotta say, Lisa, it sounds like you're strainin' to do some explainin'."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
Ned Flanders,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
Ned Flanders,"Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"
Ned Flanders,"We've come for the angel, Homer. It's not safe with the unbeliever."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
Ned Flanders,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, nothing's perfect, I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
Ned Flanders,"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my-diddily-i. Will you look at this place! And the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
Ned Flanders,"Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi, Marge. Heh-heh. Guess we gave you quite a start. We were painting Todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. Must've dozed off."
Ned Flanders,"Ahh, of course! This must be where he dropped the dagger. And this is the butler's pantry where Mrs. Astor concealed herself. And right here's where they found the torso heap! In front of our very own fireplace!"
Ned Flanders,"We appreciate the offer, Marge, but I think we're going to be very happy here."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I made some Rice Krispy squares for our hungry deprogramerinos!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh ho, I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer. But I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
Ned Flanders,Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.
Ned Flanders,"No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet."
Ned Flanders,"It says ""Show me your tie."" It's cute. C'mon, let's go."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa! January first! Better get goin' on those taxes, Neddy!"
Ned Flanders,"Hmmm. Let's see, cash-register ink. Well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? Mmm... But then I do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, why, everything! Policemen, trees, sunshine. And let's not forget the folks who just don't feel like workin', God bless 'em."
Ned Flanders,8:45?! Here I am yappin' away like it's 8:35. Don't forget the mints.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
Ned Flanders,Heh. Sports on a Sunday? Hm. I'd better check with Reverend--
Ned Flanders,Hmm. That's odd. It didn't come out the rear end.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now Roddy, it's just a stuck ball. I'll get it."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya..."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than ""Othello"" with Peter Marshall."
Ned Flanders,"I suppose, if you must know... I'm... well, I'm... I'm sixty."
Ned Flanders,"L-Listen, folks, there's no magic formula. I just follow the three C's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of Vitamin Church."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, can you believe it? It almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady Neddy."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. And some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. I'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. Maybe with a--"
Ned Flanders,Gosh darn it! Am I that pre-diddley-dictable? I've wasted my whole dang diddley life.
Ned Flanders,In the bathroom. Not trimmin' my mustache. Whaddaya think? Do I remind you of troubled troubadour David Crosby?
Ned Flanders,"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
Ned Flanders,"Of course I... Oh, my stars! I can't do that."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town!"
Ned Flanders,"If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, when I wanna laugh, I'll take Bob Saget, thank you very much."
Ned Flanders,"No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed."
Ned Flanders,"God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but I just don't feel right ab... Oh, Lord, what should I do?"
Ned Flanders,"How do you do it, Homer? How do you silence that little voice that says, ""Think""?"
Ned Flanders,"I'll have a Shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... Oh, what the heck, you only live once. Give me a..."
Ned Flanders,"Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program."
Ned Flanders,"Homer! The bad news, ladies, is we already have wives."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?"
Ned Flanders,"What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program."
Ned Flanders,How are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent--
Ned Flanders,"I don't want to be a Panicky Pete, but it's Sunday and I haven't been to church yet."
Ned Flanders,I can't believe it. We're actually in the winning locker room!
Ned Flanders,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
Ned Flanders,"You know, with all the energy we're puttin' into this sabotage thing, we coulda written sonnets for our wives, or learned to tango, or lovingly restored one of those antique..."
Ned Flanders,"Whew, well, at least I got a hunk of Moe's hair."
Ned Flanders,"Leapin' Lazarus! Is this what passes for eternal rest these days? Rod, go get Daddy his buryin' shovel."
Ned Flanders,Not so deep the Lord can't find him... and judge him.
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me, Reverend? It's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
Ned Flanders,"Doggone it, Eve, I think you'd better hightail it outta this Garden!"
Ned Flanders,"And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?"
Ned Flanders,"Maude, it's a miracle! The Lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"
Ned Flanders,Looks like Heaven's easier to get into than Arizona State.
Ned Flanders,Everything but the opinion page! I don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
Ned Flanders,"Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. They were evidence in a murder trial!"
Ned Flanders,We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar.
Ned Flanders,He taught us how to live a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar.
Ned Flanders,I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
Ned Flanders,"Now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. Oh! Man, that's good."
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho! Why bother, baby? One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog. Now let's hit the sack."
Ned Flanders,"Ha! Ha! Ha! That's for Clydes, baby. A little fire can't hurt you."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I wish. You see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
Ned Flanders,I resisted these for thirty-five years! Why did I wear them today?
Ned Flanders,"Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
Ned Flanders,I move we reconsider our club name. Make it something a little less blasphemous. After all we don't want to go to Hell.
Ned Flanders,I've got a motorhome I never use. Maybe we should raffle it off.
Ned Flanders,"Feels like I'm wearin' nothin' at all. Nothin' at all, nothin' at all..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, those poor souls. What's the Christian thing to do?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
Ned Flanders,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hm. That's the one! They've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. Ooh, cost us a bundle, too. I guess we'll have an ""Imagination Christmas"" this year."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that safety gear. Helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
Ned Flanders,"Abso-not-ly, hot Roddy. We're up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers' cussing."
Ned Flanders,"That's nice of you Homer, but I think I'll just go to bed."
Ned Flanders,"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
Ned Flanders,"If I'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, you're right. I've just got to work through the grief. There's not gonna be an easy answer."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but I feel like I've turned a corner."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? It just feels way too soon."
Ned Flanders,"Well, with triple word score, that's ninety! Ha-ha, I guess my luck is starting to even out."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm having second thoughts. This feels so disloyal to Maude."
Ned Flanders,"Mmm. Dinner was delicious, Edna, but I can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get Principal Skinner jealous."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Diane, I've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I just can't relate to the women of today, Homer. Ah, it's probably me. I'm about as exciting as a baked potato."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, I never question you... but I've been wondering if your decision to take Maude was, well, wrong... Unless this is part of your divine plan... Could you just give me some kinda sign? Anything? And after all that church chocolate I bought. Which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. Well, I've had it."
Ned Flanders,"Eh, you boys can go with the Simpsons. I'm not going to church today."
Ned Flanders,That's right. And I may not go to church tomorrow.
Ned Flanders,"No, I'm not kidding. I am gonna sit right here and miss church. You just watch."
Ned Flanders,"Electric guitars in church? Oh, my gosh. Some dropouts must have overpowered the Reverend!"
Ned Flanders,"I'll be right back, boys. I'm going to go help that lady."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, that was a lovely song. It really got to me."
Ned Flanders,"No, I hear what you're saying. It's always hard to replace someone."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that, that sounds real nice, Rachel, but a... I'm a... I'm not quite..."
Ned Flanders,"Maybe we can. My name's Ned Flanders, and I'm here every week. Rain or shine."
Ned Flanders,"Ah yeah, I never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. It was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
Ned Flanders,Yeah. Just answer me this: Are you holding your mooching sack?
Ned Flanders,"Bart, you're never gonna to grow up if I keep bailing you out."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, all right. But only because you haven't outed Rod and Todd."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, Homer, you and I worship the same God, so..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away."
Ned Flanders,Six months ago. You were at the funeral. You fell into the grave.
Ned Flanders,I'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that Hollywood hogwash.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, uh, careful, boys. That arch is lookin' a little Romanesque."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, it's Neddy. I baked you a little something to ease the pain."
Ned Flanders,"""They're Controlling Our Minds With Flu Shots?!"" I knew it. Well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no, Homer, remember? Maudie got called up to Heaven."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll just reimburse you right n-- Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot like that movie, ""Paper Moon."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow business?"
Ned Flanders,"Sure you did -- ""Mr. Plow."" You're wearin' the jacket right now!"
Ned Flanders,"Mmm-hmm. This one's fine and dandy, Roddy. It's approved by a council of Presbylutheran ministers."
Ned Flanders,"We'll just see about that-- Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake-- Nope. It's airtight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, in that case... My neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape in my house. It's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor."
Ned Flanders,"Look, if you want me to turn, just point. That w..."
Ned Flanders,...and Harry Potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
Ned Flanders,"Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on."
Ned Flanders,"I'd love to get together, but tomorrow I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool."
Ned Flanders,"Now wait just a Maude-gone minute, here. I'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
Ned Flanders,"All right, I'll take the couch and you can have my room."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation."
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, no problem. A little starch will fix her right up."
Ned Flanders,"Mm. Well, goodnight, Maude. I mean, Maude. I mean, Rachel. I mean, Maude."
Ned Flanders,"No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all."
Ned Flanders,"I sure appreciate you folks offering to go through Maude's things. If it were up to me, I wouldn't throw anything away."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?"
Ned Flanders,"Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know."
Ned Flanders,Here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...
Ned Flanders,"Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, what the heck. Who's ready to build an amusement park?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been closed for so long... and-and I thought I could turn it into a Christian theme park."
Ned Flanders,"Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money..."
Ned Flanders,"If you could do that, I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
Ned Flanders,"Morning, Kent. Our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. We're gonna show Springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
Ned Flanders,"Ohh, what can I get you, little Christian? How 'bout a Noah's Ark of Jellies?"
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Oh, please don't look at me like that."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no! This isn't a devine miracle. Everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, ah, folks, I've just discovered something about this statue that uh, may disappoint you. You see..."
Ned Flanders,"Hello, Gas Company? How poisonous is your gas?... Wow. But-- Eh, but I'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... How could that be worse?... Okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... I see."
Ned Flanders,"How 'bout I explain it to you over a cup of coffee. That is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, I need to ask ya a favor. My baby sitter canceled and I got tickets to a Christian rock concert."
Ned Flanders,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
Ned Flanders,Would you mind watching the kids? I'm kinda in a pickle here.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. Anyway, thanks again."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
Ned Flanders,You're using my table saw to violate a court order?
Ned Flanders,"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
Ned Flanders,"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
Ned Flanders,"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
Ned Flanders,"My Satan sense is tingling! Into the root cellar, boys!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, Ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, I know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. But, uh, I know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so I will."
Ned Flanders,Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. It's the best darn diddly way to start your first Flanders day!
Ned Flanders,"Whoops. Watch the swears, Honey Bear. We don't use the ""I"" word in this house."
Ned Flanders,I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.
Ned Flanders,"Now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of Trojans."
Ned Flanders,"Heaven and earth... Where were we? Oh, now I'm lost."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
Ned Flanders,"Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers."
Ned Flanders,...The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The End.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, hey, now hold on there. The nice people want to hear the real words."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Here's a preview. GOD SAID TO NOAH / BUILD YOURSELF AN ARK-Y ARK-Y / ANIMALS CAME ON BY ONES AND TWOSIES, TWOSIES / ELEPHANTS AND KANGAROOSIES - ROOSIES..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It. Did you catch the thief?"
Ned Flanders,"I don't know, neighboreenos, I'm all for Halloween fun, but a sÃ©ance sounds a little PG-13."
Ned Flanders,Maude! You still look as pretty as the day I buried you.
Ned Flanders,"Say Homer, I was, uh, I was wondering if I could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me."
Ned Flanders,"Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?"
Ned Flanders,"Boy, that's Jim Dandy roof candy! I'd love to come over some time and watch that Church Channel."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you'd win that bet. Seems like I'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. Or as I like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, cock-a-diddily-doo! What a Marge-alicious way to start my Flander-rific day."
Ned Flanders,"Shop o' the mornin', Homer! Just call me ""Mall"" Flanders."
Ned Flanders,You betcha! This kiosk sells personalized movies. I had one made starring little Rod.
Ned Flanders,"Now Rainier, I really don't think it's right to sell these Playdude centerfolds."
Ned Flanders,You betcha. It's a nice break from the male sports I usually watch.
Ned Flanders,"Oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
Ned Flanders,"Gosh, fifty thousand dollars? I'm donating this whole check to ""Bibles for Belgians."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, please don't sue the church. I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
Ned Flanders,"Where you going, Reverend? The town's that way. Reverend? You're goin' the wrong way!"
Ned Flanders,"No, no, you're lying! You're lying! What makes you lie?"
Ned Flanders,"Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?"
Ned Flanders,"Okay boys, this is it. The end of this sinful little suburb."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, Sea Captain, looks like you and I are sailin' solo tonight."
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
Ned Flanders,"Form of business? Sole proprietorship. ""Owner's marital status?"" Happily married... to a dead woman."
Ned Flanders,"Mm hmm! Open as a tomb on Easter. Now, what can I ding dong diddily do for ya?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I should say not. I gave up on L.A. when those TV people made that poor nun fly. All those Puerto Ricans lookin' up her dress. That's not right."
Ned Flanders,Do I! No I don't. But I can have 'em here by Tuesday.
Ned Flanders,"I sure do. You're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
Ned Flanders,"A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon."
Ned Flanders,WELL I'VE GOT A DATE WITH A GIRL WITH NO NAME / IT SURE FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE GAME / AT DESSERT MAYBE I CAN ASK HER HER NAME / 'CAUSE I CAN'T PRAY FOR HER WITHOUT THE RIGHT NAME...
Ned Flanders,"No, it's Sara Sloane. I have a date with her tonight."
Ned Flanders,Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett."
Ned Flanders,"... Rod says ""Marco,"" and darn it if Todd doesn't say ""Polo"" right back! Oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. You're probably bored silly."
Ned Flanders,Heaven's gate! I'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week.
Ned Flanders,"Yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between Los Angeles and New York. Called America!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least I can do."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This movie's turning into Sponge Bob No-Pants!"
Ned Flanders,"Sir, there's no reason Sara needs to do this scene in the altogether."
Ned Flanders,Yep. Now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of Scrabble.
Ned Flanders,Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
Ned Flanders,The paparazzi! I thought we fooled them with our Cher-crow.
Ned Flanders,I'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!
Ned Flanders,No way! I won't even eat vegetables over two inches long.
Ned Flanders,"So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically."
Ned Flanders,Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a casket.
Ned Flanders,Well of course. Wait a minute. This is to adopt two of your kids.
Ned Flanders,"Hop to it, honey! If we get to the Pops concert early, we can give up our seats to some old people."
Ned Flanders,"Sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Siegfried and Roy create a lot of illusions, but I doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I hate to say it, but your top's upstaging the Pops!"
Ned Flanders,"Sara, I love ya, but I get the feeling you're just... not a Ned-head tonight. Is something wrong?"
Ned Flanders,"Se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly..."
Ned Flanders,This is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. I better talk this over with the big man.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" You know, the cow being me."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
Ned Flanders,It says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. And that's good enough for me.
Ned Flanders,Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
Ned Flanders,"I love you, too. And I always will. But unlike the Bible, I guess this isn't gonna have a happy ending."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, darn the luck. That sounds like the Lupus Fun Run."
Ned Flanders,You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
Ned Flanders,Why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
Ned Flanders,And it wouldn't hurt you to put up some curtains.
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. But it looks like you're missin' a piece."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Homer, I think you want your house, next door."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the Bible says it's fun to do stuff together."
Ned Flanders,"THERE'S A STRANGER IN THE MANGER AND HIS NAME IS LOVE Take it, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
Ned Flanders,"Why thank you, Homer. It's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
Ned Flanders,"THEN I DOUBT YOU'LL LIKE NED FLANDERS / OR HIS CREEPY LITTLE OFFSPRING, ROD AND TODD..."
Ned Flanders,"I got your letter, Jesus and I'm coming as fast as I can."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
Ned Flanders,Scared of what? All the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? WE'LL BE SAFE INSIDE OUR FORTRESS WHEN THEY COME / WE'LL BE SAFE FROM CREEPS AND KILLERS WHEN THEY COME / UNLESS THEY HAVE A BLOWTORCH / OR A POISON GAS INJECTOR / THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN THEY COME!
Ned Flanders,Of course I am. They were bigger than Jesus! But your boy went Yoko and broke up my collection.
Ned Flanders,Oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. The only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. What these boys need is adult supervision.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I did finish first in the Walk For The Cure... of homosexuality."
Ned Flanders,"I'm dying! And there's Heaven. But who's that? Confucius? And Milton Berle? Boy, have I been barkin' up the wrong tree."
Ned Flanders,"Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans."
Ned Flanders,"Gee, looks like this town has a good Sam log-jam."
Ned Flanders,HERE COME SANDWICHES / HERE COME SANDWICHES / RIGHT DOWN BOOZY BUM LANE...
Ned Flanders,BROTHER NED'S GOT CHEESE ON BREAD / AND A SIDE ORDER OF SHAME...
Ned Flanders,"Why, I'll give you a jump, I'll rotate your tires, I'll even fold up that map for you. I know they can be a dickens of a doozy..."
Ned Flanders,That tears it. I'll show Homer. I'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
Ned Flanders,"My angle is givin' in this world, livin' in the next."
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually, I picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
Ned Flanders,"Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
Ned Flanders,"""And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, you look like you could use a nice big stud... detector."
Ned Flanders,"They were two for one at Krusty Home Depot, so I got an extra one for you guys!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. If so, then I guess I'm just a cave man. If they existed, which they didn't!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess it wouldn't kill me to let you in."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box."
Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
Ned Flanders,"Now now, remember why we're here: to celebrate Jasper's birthday."
Ned Flanders,"Huh, credit card bill seems a little chunky this month."
Ned Flanders,Let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the VISA.
Ned Flanders,"Well this is one dilly of a daily, Lisa. Can't wait for tomorrow's!"
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Ned. Just because you foresaw Dr. Hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. It was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
Ned Flanders,What the Family Circus? A second premonition came to fruition.
Ned Flanders,"Lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
Ned Flanders,Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
Ned Flanders,'Cause I had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
Ned Flanders,"Don't worry, sweetie. I am not going to kill your father."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three."
Ned Flanders,"I was supposed to shoot you, but I didn't! I changed the future!"
Ned Flanders,What have I done? I've changed the future for the worse.
Ned Flanders,I gotta find Homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
Ned Flanders,I just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
Ned Flanders,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
Ned Flanders,"You know I was gonna enter this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff... but up against you, I wouldn't have a Hindu's chance in Heaven."
Ned Flanders,"Well, my Roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
Ned Flanders,"Let's see... ""Get Bent."" Well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. We'll take the whole box. Get bent, everyone!"
Ned Flanders,"Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
Ned Flanders,I was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
Ned Flanders,"Hello, neighborino to the north. I sure like the cut of your gibberish."
Ned Flanders,"Not that convenience store crap, is it? Because I don't feed that to my dogs."
Ned Flanders,"Here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll just call you friend. Here's your tape... friend."
Ned Flanders,"There's nothing but filth on TV. But with this new video camera, we can make our own entertainment!"
Ned Flanders,"Now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of Cain and Abel!"
Ned Flanders,"Your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! Now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
Ned Flanders,"Boys, I just talked to God. He's vacuuming Heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. And He'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
Ned Flanders,"Now I must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
Ned Flanders,"Now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. We can put the sound in later."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I-I guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal European wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of Miss Ashley Judd!"
Ned Flanders,"Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message."
Ned Flanders,Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.
Ned Flanders,"""So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them... Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the Earth. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between God and man."" Thank you."
Ned Flanders,"Well now Roddy, the Lord wouldn't let us die this way."
Ned Flanders,"Well, we could use a new H.Q. for the Springfield Philharmonic. They're playing Gustav Mahler in abject squalor."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him."
Ned Flanders,"Gee, I thought my vision was perfect. And here I was, worshiping false eyeballs."
Ned Flanders,"Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-Rapture party."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy, Homer. You here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sorry, but I promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
Ned Flanders,"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."
Ned Flanders,"He scampered out of Parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
Ned Flanders,"You like 'em, huh? Come on, I'll show you the other three hundred."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't take money from a neighbor. Although, business at the Leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
Ned Flanders,"Well, it might be fun to be a landlord. Landfella -- there's only one Lord!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... Now, do you have any pets?"
Ned Flanders,"You poor thing! I've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. Girls, welcome to your very own Ned and Breakfast."
Ned Flanders,"Here's your room, ladies. You can catch some Z's while you earn those degrees."
Ned Flanders,I coulda sworn I just heard someone shriek my name.
Ned Flanders,You soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. And sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
Ned Flanders,The whole town is laughing at me behind my back. I guess you're the only real friend I have.
Ned Flanders,"The Bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Toddy, you know how I said our friends are like the Canaanites? Today I realized they're more like the Midianites."
Ned Flanders,I wish we lived in a place more like the America of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us Republicans.
Ned Flanders,"""Made in Humbleton, PA."" I don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that I bought at a garage sale. But corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
Ned Flanders,The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
Ned Flanders,This town is sweeter than a cake made of pie. Even the dogs curb themselves.
Ned Flanders,"Get rid of Dr. Fuzzenstein? Why, I couldn't dream of thinking about considering..."
Ned Flanders,You know what? I'm not gonna. My mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's really touching. But my boys and I are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
Ned Flanders,"That tears it! Boys, put on your goody two-shoes. We're moving back to Springfield!"
Ned Flanders,"So you see Mr. Roberts, I really would like my house back."
Ned Flanders,"Now coach, I've tried to be Christian and respectful, but I guess I'm just gonna have to point out your two hundred thousand dollar check bounced. Legally, I still own this house."
Ned Flanders,It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
Ned Flanders,"Marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council. To Stuckey's!"
Ned Flanders,Bart and Homer can't go Catholic! The Romans have been separate from us since the Schism of Lourdes in 1573. And that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. Which we've since abolished.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip."
Ned Flanders,He's right. Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
Ned Flanders,"Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?"
Ned Flanders,Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
Ned Flanders,"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
Ned Flanders,"Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,Please change me back! This bumble bee has developed an unhealthy obsession with me.
Ned Flanders,You want me to deliver the Christmas sermon? I feel like I'm born again again!
Ned Flanders,"Don't be nervous, Ned. You've practiced this so many times in the shower."
Ned Flanders,HOW I LOVE MY COAT OF MANY COLORS / IT WAS RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / AND SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH / AND RUBY AND OLIVE AND VIOLET AND FAWN...
Ned Flanders,...AND LILAC AND GOLD AND CHOCOLATE AND MAUVE / AND CREAM AND CRIMSON AND SILVER AND ROSE / AND AZURE AND LEMON AND RUSSET AND GREY...
Ned Flanders,AND PURPLE AND WHITE AND PINK AND ORANGE / AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN AND BROWN / SCARLET AND BLACK AND OCHRE AND PEACH...
Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, we could do a little Quid Pro for the Kay-Pro. The left-handed convention is in town, and as the owner of Springfield's largest southpaw shop, I just gotta be there. Could you uh, nanny-goat my kid-diddly-ids?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
Ned Flanders,"Here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type."
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, wow, it's the Big Unit himself, Randy Johnson! You've fanned more men than Salome!"
Ned Flanders,Hiya Marge. Rod and Todd in the land of nod?
Ned Flanders,"Hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
Ned Flanders,"It's the ripcord from a Band-Aid wrapper! Call me Ned Zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I think it's about time you boys get to bed."
Ned Flanders,"And so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
Ned Flanders,I just can't. They're all I've got since that sad day when Maude found eternal happiness.
Ned Flanders,"Well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet... why not?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm not Ned, I'm a friendly dog. Oh, I'm not a good liar. I did come here to check on the... where's Rod?"
Ned Flanders,He chipped a tooth! How will he bite Wheat Thins? How?
Ned Flanders,"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM / I'LL MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN / WHEN PLAYTIME IS A SAFE TIME, EVERYBODY WINS..."
Ned Flanders,NOW I'LL LAY DOWN SOME ASTRO TURF / SO THEY DON'T SCRAPE THEIR N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-KNEES...
Ned Flanders,"Well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
Ned Flanders,"Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle. All diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
Ned Flanders,"Rod... You can do it, boy! With God on your side, you can't fail!"
Ned Flanders,"Lord, with you watching over me I shall feel no pain."
Ned Flanders,"Only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? Well I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! Tell you what, I'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
Ned Flanders,"Tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
Ned Flanders,"You're leavin' already? We, we haven't even gotten in yet."
Ned Flanders,Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?
Ned Flanders,No one was ever a monkey! Everything is what it was and always will be! God put us here and that's that!
Ned Flanders,They're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. Even though there's nothing about it in the Bible!
Ned Flanders,We want you to teach alternative theories to Darwinian evolution.
Ned Flanders,As sure as I am that Jesus hates Hip Hop!
Ned Flanders,"Well, I wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, Lisa."
Ned Flanders,What say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?
Ned Flanders,"I... uh... I got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... I'll just pay it."
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but I just want to thank you for your early Christmas card."
Ned Flanders,"Oh I don't mean to cause Gil ill will, but still..."
Ned Flanders,"Tonight's G-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! And while you enjoy this quiet riot, I'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
Ned Flanders,"He's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I wish! No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
Ned Flanders,"Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
Ned Flanders,Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
Ned Flanders,"This is it, boys -- One more out and we go to the championship game. Let's do it for Groundskeeper Willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
Ned Flanders,"Now Bart, stay humble! Your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head."
Ned Flanders,"A damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! Oil-based!"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, ""Smallville""... super dog licks himself. That definitely goes in the naughty pile!"
Ned Flanders,"Sixty Minutes -- Morley Safer has questionable pants fold -- ""The L Word"" -- used the ""L"" word."
Ned Flanders,Imploring people I never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. That's what I'm doing!
Ned Flanders,So it is! I'm just here to pay the fine for the Sunday School bus. You towed it with the kids still in it!
Ned Flanders,"You know what they say: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""
Ned Flanders,I've got something that will scare the H-E-double sippy straws out of them.
Ned Flanders,Welcome to Heck House! You're about to discover what a life of sin will get you!
Ned Flanders,"No, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
Ned Flanders,"Please, Lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
Ned Flanders,Springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! Starting with... GLUTTONY!
Ned Flanders,"That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal! Welcome to the club!"
Ned Flanders,"I can't say for sure, but as a Christian, I assume the worst."
Ned Flanders,What're we gonna do? We can't not vote. Nobody does that!
Ned Flanders,Banks? Well deposit yourselves in a seat 'cause you've earned my interest!
Ned Flanders,"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
Ned Flanders,"Listen Sheriff, I can help you take down Bonnie and Clyde."
Ned Flanders,Um... the battery seems to be dead. I'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
Ned Flanders,"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
Ned Flanders,"Yep, I'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
Ned Flanders,"Young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
Ned Flanders,"Well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
Ned Flanders,Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
Ned Flanders,"Us... a team? As the salad said to the soup, ""I'm all mixed up."""
Ned Flanders,"Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. And also, thank you for my partner Homer, who..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes."
Ned Flanders,I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS
Ned Flanders,KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS / AND THEY'RE DONE FOR FREE
Ned Flanders,"Lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!"
Ned Flanders,"You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
Ned Flanders,"Forget it! I am turning in my... well, I don't really have anything to turn in. So that's that! I suggest you call Homer Simpson."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me."
Ned Flanders,I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
Ned Flanders,For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!
Ned Flanders,"I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in."
Ned Flanders,"""...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."" Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. ""The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."""
Ned Flanders,...Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.
Ned Flanders,Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, strangers! Hop on in before you become a couple runneth over!"
Ned Flanders,"And in that mud, I'm plantin' the seed of friendship. Name's Ned Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,"As the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!"
Ned Flanders,"Wordplay: never cared for it. But it's never too soon for you two to join the ""I do"" crew. Now I'm not sayin' it's all Jell-O with Cool Whip. She'll nag ya. She'll try to change ya. You'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
Ned Flanders,I think I'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
Ned Flanders,"Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
Ned Flanders,"Aw, Maude. Your dead grandmother's pajamas. You know what that does to me."
Ned Flanders,"What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
Ned Flanders,Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
Ned Flanders,"Red Dog, this is Mustache One. We have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
Ned Flanders,"As the worm said to the plate of spaghetti, ""I... I..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, maybe I could use a break from the ol' Weed 'N' Feed."
Ned Flanders,Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!
Ned Flanders,So I can rent it back to you. Just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, I appreciate the sediment."
Ned Flanders,"Say Homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually... as your landlord, repairs are my responsibility. I'll just get my tools..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, as you are my tenants, I'll see what I can do."
Ned Flanders,"When I was putting new insulation in your attic, I slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm sorry, I just had my glass of warm milk which means I am closed for business!"
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, say, ""Jesus,"" what was the name of the son of Zachariah?"
Ned Flanders,"You two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, Christian but not Baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... interesting."
Ned Flanders,"Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind."
Ned Flanders,I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, cool your jets! We're trying to get to sleep!"
Ned Flanders,Parson! Parson! Give us a quick official church position on family.
Ned Flanders,"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'd put rocks into your pockets and walk you out to sea before that happened."
Ned Flanders,"Okily-dokily. But I'm warning you, you're gonna see America's number-one dishwashing crew!"
Ned Flanders,Then I give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go!
Ned Flanders,"oh, they're grounded. I found out Rod watched a commercial for ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and Todd took a full day to tell me."
Ned Flanders,Just as I feared: her Buddhism has led directly to witchcraft.
Ned Flanders,And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell!
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, it looks like your Dad is a quotable notable."
Ned Flanders,"You know Marge, Maude and I had a fight right before she died..."
Ned Flanders,"You know, maybe I should use a towel marked ""B.D.D."" -- big diddily deal!"
Ned Flanders,I play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
Ned Flanders,"Now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""Welcome to Bible study!"""
Ned Flanders,"Today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of Matthew twenty-three."
Ned Flanders,"Now let us ""download"" the holy ""tweet"" of the Lord."
Ned Flanders,Duly noted. But we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
Ned Flanders,"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
Ned Flanders,"Oh Reverend, I've been workin' my bible to the bone tryin' to save that man."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
Ned Flanders,"Yep. I also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
Ned Flanders,The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's not why we're here. We can see the stations of the cross!"
Ned Flanders,"Lord, please help Homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,"And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. And thank you, again, for the challenge of Homer Simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. Me Homer, you the cross. And now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of..."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock."
Ned Flanders,Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
Ned Flanders,"Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!"
Ned Flanders,You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
Ned Flanders,"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
Ned Flanders,"It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving."
Ned Flanders,Nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to Jekyll down this Hyde.
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, looks like a sandstorm's brewin'. I'll just wait it out at a movie."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."
Ned Flanders,You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
Ned Flanders,I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!
Ned Flanders,Maybe. But I feel a little like I'm the Tom Voyeur to these Huckleberry Sinners.
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me, that's your salad fork!... That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only!... What's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""Happy Birthday?"""
Ned Flanders,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
Ned Flanders,"Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Ned Flanders,Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!
Ned Flanders,"Inspiration Point looks pretty uninspired... All's quiet in Murder Town... Yep, Springfield is cleaner than the Lord's hand towels."
Ned Flanders,"Rod? Hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
Ned Flanders,"I see you now. Rod, you and Todd stay in the house."
Ned Flanders,But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
Ned Flanders,I guess I did create this... like God created the devil.
Ned Flanders,"I never wanted to turn into Big Brother. I just wanted to be Little Sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
Ned Flanders,That's the worst sin of all for some reason! What can I do to make things right?
Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, Marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, God made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, neighbor. You look as puffed up as a peacock in a..."
Ned Flanders,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
Ned Flanders,"Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team."
Ned Flanders,"In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just don't like the monster I've become."
Ned Flanders,"Excuse me! With all this racket, my boys can't get their sixteen hours sleep."
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, Mr. Burns! For our half hour I thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, don't be scared, boys. That's just the angels bowling."
Ned Flanders,"Actually, it's kind of cute. You look like Posh Spice."
Ned Flanders,Did a volcano erupt in Candyland? 'Cause I just caught me a flyin' red hot!
Ned Flanders,"You know, I don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. Anyhoo, so I don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card."
Ned Flanders,"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
Ned Flanders,"Bart Simpson? Why, he lives right next door to me! Yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."
Ned Flanders,"Homer? Yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... I guess. So, what say we have lunch?"
Ned Flanders,"...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I'm afraid my Maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now."
Ned Flanders,"Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
Ned Flanders,"And you're a former Mrs. So, uh... where's your husband buried?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh boy, that laugh is infectious. Ha!... Ha!... that's fun!"
Ned Flanders,"Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but I'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
Ned Flanders,Oh yes they were! We deliberately chose a Doctor Stork so we could say it without lying.
Ned Flanders,"But I think if we hold off for a while, you'll find I'm well worth the wait. Like a mild cheddar I get tangy when I'm sittin' on the shelf."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, what the heck. I know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a Ken Burns documentary, but you're that special."
Ned Flanders,"I don't wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote ""CHURCHY JOE"" on my face."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
Ned Flanders,Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
Ned Flanders,"That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time."
Ned Flanders,"Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor."
Ned Flanders,Oh I was just wondering how many boxes of staples I should order for the store. Does ten sound like a lot to you? Twenty? Fifty? What does sound like a lot to you?
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it! Edna, call me Delta Airlines 'cause I can't handle your extra baggage."
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I had a long walk with Homer Simpson yesterday, and as I was carrying him back home, I had a lot of time to think."
Ned Flanders,"You've been with a lot of men, but I forgive you!"
Ned Flanders,I guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
Ned Flanders,"Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
Ned Flanders,I started drinking orange juice with pulp! I asked the Reverend and he said it was okay. Then he hung right up on me. That man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
Ned Flanders,We just wanted to give you all a big thank you from Team Nedna.
Ned Flanders,"Springfield. My home town. Pretty little place. Although, even the Garden of Eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
Ned Flanders,Spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
Ned Flanders,"All these years I thought murder was a sin. Then, I got new instructions from the good Lord Himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- English."
Ned Flanders,And so white-bread Ned became the avenging sword of the Lord.
Ned Flanders,"Peter, Andrew, James the Greater, James the Lesser, John, Philip, Thaddeus!"
Ned Flanders,"Patty and Selma?! Sure they smoke, and they don't shave much of anything, but... do they deserve to die?"
Ned Flanders,Hell! Damn! Backside! Nothing matters anymore! I'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
Ned Flanders,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been."
Ned Flanders,"It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth."
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth Sunday after Easter. We'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment I wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, she went crazy. Crazier than sleeping in on a Sunday."
Ned Flanders,"Welcome to the ""Cross"" Games, Simpsons! A Christian fellowship expo!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh no, ""Games"" stands for Gathering of American Messengers for Evangelical Sports!"
Ned Flanders,"Sure is! That's why after Homer accidentally killed Edna, I married Maude's ghost!"
Ned Flanders,"I thought I smelled death-a-diddly. What is that, an eight-pointer?"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way I write."
Ned Flanders,That's just fine as long as you're not a Mormon!
Ned Flanders,Bedbugs? Just why is there a bed in City Hall?
Ned Flanders,"Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors..."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, credits include Jesus in the passion play last year, Jesus in the passion play the year before that, Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be -- you guessed it, St. Peter..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, congratulations, Homer. Guess this is just my cross to bear."
Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer's givin' it the old bible college try. Maybe I should have dialed down the Doubting Thomas."
Ned Flanders,"Lord, forgive me for my pride. All-wise, as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me."
Ned Flanders,"No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong."
Ned Flanders,'Cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.
Ned Flanders,"Boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?"
Ned Flanders,"Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry honey, but I'm stuck in this meeting of the Springfield L.G.B.T. The Left-Gifted, Bidextrous, and Transhanded community. We're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""Left is Right"" parade."
Ned Flanders,This could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. Can you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir... when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili. I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary."
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's just great, boys. Now, come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo."
Ned Flanders,"Chillax?! Young man, in the Flanders house, we speak the King's Diddily."
Ned Flanders,"You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! Now, just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?! This marriage isn't perfect!"
Ned Flanders,"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
Ned Flanders,"I just felt so ashamed I just couldn't go home. Today, I gave in to the one thing I vowed I would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
Ned Flanders,"So after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
Ned Flanders,Pause the assembly! I have to talk to my wife!
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I'm sorry and I'll say it in front of God or Groundskeeper Willie!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a bible. What do you say, sweetie?"
Ned Flanders,MY MOUSTACHE / IS BRISTLY / MY LETTERS / ARE EPISTLY / AND I DON'T WANNA / MISLEAD YOU / I LIKE TO HUG AND KISSLY--
Ned Flanders,"FIRST BASE, YO! / I LIKE CHRISTIAN RAP / A BIBLE ON MY LAP..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, hello! It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
Ned Flanders,"Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. Darnit, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive!"
Ned Flanders,"Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
Ned Flanders,"Edna, I'm not one for costumes, but I sure do like that feather in your hair."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, God's there, with His little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
Ned Flanders,"I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""The Feud Network"" to ""Comity Central."""
Ned Flanders,Mind if I come over and sweeten your greetin'. Sweeten your greetin'! SWEETEN YOUR GREETIN'!
Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
Ned Flanders,And the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park."
Ned Flanders,Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
Ned Flanders,"Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!"
Ned Flanders,There's no emergency here! And please charge us for the false report! I'm going out for a power walk.
Ned Flanders,"Marge, I've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! This is a clip-on!"
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, Homer. Now, do you mind if I pray at your bedside?"
Ned Flanders,Was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? That's what I wanna know.
Ned Flanders,Nope... not that... not to my taste... flag that for later... finally!
Ned Flanders,"""Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
Ned Flanders,"I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. Punch me."
Ned Flanders,No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!
Ned Flanders,"Come on, people! You're safe as Sunday with me. I wouldn't hurt a fly!"
Ned Flanders,"My prayers have been answered! Well actually, just this one."
Ned Flanders,"You wanna hit me. Well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
Ned Flanders,Now you can shatter my orbital bone! That'll knock the wax off my candle!
Ned Flanders,"You know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? Well, sir, I want you to rid of Lisa's bully teacher."
Ned Flanders,I'm glad the only beef between us is this burger!
Ned Flanders,"How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, the good news is it forced us all to church."
Ned Flanders,Church songs with clapping... I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.
Ned Flanders,He's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
Ned Flanders,God doesn't need Twitter to reach people. He uses leprosy and plagues.
Ned Flanders,Neither! And I don't like it when other people rhyme!
Ned Flanders,I'd like to turn in this boy for thinkin' about doin' something naughty... and myself for waiting thirty seconds before bringing him here.
Ned Flanders,Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories. You treat them with respect.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
Ned Flanders,"Pray for a miracle, boy! God can hear you better from up there!"
Ned Flanders,That sounds salty but you seem sweet. I'm gonna call you kettle corn!
Ned Flanders,I haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!
Ned Flanders,"Well... I'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place."
Ned Flanders,Children... perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.
Ned Flanders,"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
Ned Flanders,Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
Ned Flanders,Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
Ned Flanders,Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
Ned Flanders,"I told you, the only dancing I like is ""square."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, we pulled more plugs than a Dutch doctor. Now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
Ned Flanders,Why that's a higher power than even I believe in. What is going on?
Ned Flanders,"Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me."
Ned Flanders,Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through."
Ned Flanders,Sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. Are you just buying this to be nice?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?"
Ned Flanders,This is a whole new relationship for us! We'll be friends! In this life and the next!
Ned Flanders,Am I hearing this right? Is the church council truly considering... gambling?
Ned Flanders,"Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. Our mission is one hundred percent pure."
Ned Flanders,She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
Ned Flanders,"See Marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
Ned Flanders,This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this--
Ned Flanders,"Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
Ned Flanders,"Hey there, neighbor! The Lord's certainly given us a beautiful day today. Huh?"
Ned Flanders,"Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
Ned Flanders,"Well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there."
Ned Flanders,"Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me."
Ned Flanders,"Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, your beer. Uh, is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week."
Ned Flanders,"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
Ned Flanders,"Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand."
Ned Flanders,Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Ned Flanders,And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19."
Ned Flanders,"A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend."
Ned Flanders,"I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now."
Ned Flanders,"Say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?"
Ned Flanders,"All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good."
Ned Flanders,"Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance."
Ned Flanders,"All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
Ned Flanders,"All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!"
Ned Flanders,"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
Ned Flanders,"Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt."
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
Ned Flanders,"But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
Ned Flanders,"Oh my, Lisa was wonderful. She certainly's come a long way with her fingering."
Ned Flanders,"Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy."
Ned Flanders,"Okey-dokel. Hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'."
Ned Flanders,"I should box your ears you, you, you... You Sneaky Pete!"
Ned Flanders,"Ohhh. I wanted to subscribe to that new Arts and Crafts Channel. Well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks."
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
Ned Flanders,"Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
